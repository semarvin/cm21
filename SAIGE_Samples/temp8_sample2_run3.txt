======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
From the depths of the sea to the height of mountains the oceans rise; but between the continents man is unaware of the waves rising. They are men and women. They are like our fish ... In the depths man breathes ... In the depths man breathes. Breathes. Waves high ... the water will break ... ... the bracelet of the waves ... ... the bracelet of the wind ... ... the bracelet of water ... ... the water ... ...

The bracelet of the wind ... 

The bracelet of man ... 

Then to the earth and to the fish ...
... and... And finally... and... and...

It is in the depths of this perpetual night that today man comes to discover the mysteries of love. The love that binds him all his life. In his bedroom in the barracks he hears the creaking of the door and sees that all winter long he has waited for this love: a useless and closed world, which tears him away in its own sleep. He sleeps, forgetting the long hours, open to the sound of the echoing music of the barracks and the distant whistling of the water cannons. He sleeps for the night that is, for love, that is, for love that is forever. The trees of that wood, the ships of the sea, the trees of that shipwrecked that clear water in the waves? These are the people that I am and the song of those ships is the sea that man sleeps on, the sea that he sleeps in the tower of Babel. The way he sleeps: the way the grasses sleep, the trees sleep, the grasses sleep, the fallow shrubs sleep, the houses sleep, the sleeping of the squares, the nights sleep, night sleep, and the birds sleep, too. How handsome that he is dreaming: sleeping, perhaps, but never dreaming, is impossible: the rhythm of his breathing is lost, and an invisible mark is fastening him on his armor. He is not a prey, prey is not enough: in truth the bracelet of the wind is still on that wound, and the wound is scarcely wide open. He dreams, yes he breaths, and he often loses his temper. But never with you, with you whose memory has not been strong enough to withstand the tide of your appeal, the tide of your appeal, that day for all your generations and which will remain the day that you will never leave this place. You were the first, O Cynthia, O Cynthia of old, O Cynthia of heart, O Cynthia of the dreams, the Cynthia of the winds, O Cynthia of the waters. Now O God, O Cynthia, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God, O God... 
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon. And in these learned days, in the free cities of the earth, idolatry is no longer tolerated. Children idolate their elders, and their fathers. But these daydreaming boys who climb the insanitary heights of the cities where civilization no longer exists, but leap over the smashed roofs, the demolition shops, the well lit highways, and the cries of newborn vermin, but never more loudly than on one like themselves who will one day set foot on these desolate streets, and you, Babylon, God of Sea, will become the first to walk with us in space. 
You, God of Sea. I knew you, and I was oppressed by your indomitable will, by your prideful ignorance. Babylon, God of Sea. I saw your genius, and I thought you were doomed to eternal damnation as to its fate with the earth or the sun. The future of our race is at stake, and with it the greatest naval might, economic strength, and moral greatness. But to deny that the most deadly threat to humanity is the Thesaurus deriving on the platform is useless. The only solution is to make the Earth our Beautiful.[1] Naked, Amie, run. And Naked, Amie, running. 
[2] What a pity that Amie, the mother of all excuses, was quiet about this subject. She wanted to be alone. 
[3] I know, I know: Am I the only one to enjoy seeing words like "revolutionary" and "revolutionary-minded" applied to the so-called shortcomings of a person? In any case, nothing is easier than to look at a photograph of a famous person and to realize that such a person is completely unaware of his or her eyes, that there are movements of THE MEANING, the way one sees the parts of the eye really SING, the way the part of the eye that 1 has lost, the part of the face that 1 cannot see, have left a huge imprint on his mind. 
[4] The extremely intelligent take pride in this. To cite one example: a certain person who loved to write had to be sure of
