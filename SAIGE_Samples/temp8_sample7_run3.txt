======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
I have a daughter and have a very hard time imagining her spending any more than I would spend my whole life with her.
But I can envisage her as a bird of burden tolerable to be held responsible for its weight. A bird of burden. So I can envisage her as well. A very fat, very thin bird. A very smart bird. Sentiment will dictate that I should have her about her age, around 25. She should also be able to spend her days without feeling guilty, with people of a more pleasant age, less like the present and perhaps more like a tricolore." 
"But," asked Mademoiselle Dixson, "have you considered the social and economic importance of mental life, and if not, why not the other way?" 
"Well," resumed the grandmother, "why not take such a stroll among your human friends, the human friends who have never been able to quit the circle of love, of lust? I can bet your life and my life, that by now you will be quiet and resigned, and I will be bolder, I can promise you that." 
"You will fight harder than ever. The road to power can only narrow when a mob of young men overruns the state-approved courts. When those who set about trying to take our little sister from her clingy, old-fashioned parents take advantage of the chaos to hold a political rally are not only incompatible with the ideals that have made civilized life possible for us all, but also destructive as well. But first we all have to give our all to try and, above all, save our sovereigns. We absolute flacks, we absolute Blanches, we absolute Baignantons. And we our friends of the political rally will be necessary in all this if the government not only passes an eye-wagering, but also if it stumbles and stumbles and falls flat. This is why it is so easy to foresee the impending crisis and why I am so happy to present my views as to the most pressing matters. I predict: 
certain strikes to be exact for all those who own up to the state of their futures and because of them. Strikes will help the little boat that is not ours to an unbreakable flight. If we let the steam rise toand the little boat sink, we will all drown in its wake. I predict a thousand lashes and a certain fine tune that will not be seen again. If the state does not lend its hand, the little boat will drown in the river because of the wind and if the little boat drowns in the river it is because the fish in the river are trying to break a watch. If the fish in the river drowns and the little boat is trying to make its way back to land, I so order the little boat to come and bring back back the fish which has missed his boat. I am the true-believer. I have heard your reproaches and I demand that your right to fish not be respected any more. I demand that your right to fish not be used against anyone except against native fish. 

â€”That is what I would say if I were your neighbor. 
I repeat it, it is better that I die trying than that I get all upset after knowing it, and trying to remedy it. The little boat I am trying to reach is not the real boat, it is a little sail. It is not the real boat which I am looking for, it is rather a bunch of lilies and a stick. It is not a contradiction in gravity that I am looking for a boat, I am seeking a technical term for the hardiness of the water: sluice, and the lily, if you like. She seems to be the favorite with crocodiles, and if I was looking to see what sort of thing a graceful corpse would do, then surely there is no reason to go hunting with this woman in the sky above us. I am looking for something very, very, very, very wrong with this corpse. It is a strange oil, a strange dye. If it were true that it came from a legendary creature rather than a simple metamorphosis (which, of course, is very important), it would show us, first of all, what kind of connection the mysterious oil has at the moment with our religion (for, really, what does a religion mean, what does not depend on the fate of the mother lily, what, in that case, would depend on the fate of the penis?). But what is very, very wrong with this idea, Reverend, is to get confused with any metaphysical idea. It is quite possible that your idea, so completely at odds with mine, you were simply waiting for the miracle to happen that you abandoned the case of metaphysics very headlong into your own field. 
I shall spare you the details, just read the book in which the miracle took place:
