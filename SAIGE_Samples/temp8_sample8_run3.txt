======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
When the child was growing up (and I'm an early convert), her father was a policeman in the army. He held onto this faith by serving his country, and for this very reason, we were told he didn't go off on a great goose chase. He left his wife at this very moment, carried on his pious mission, and there we have Sybil and his little sister excelled at the world of the hustled carriage boys, the rote gossip of the village dells, the clustered innuendos of shoeblacks, while the boys of the big towns fought for each other on the earth with fierce zeal. When I was little, Papa and I went to the Débarcadore Place to play in the river. When that little village boy left without ever seeing the raft again, we didn't know what to think.
We lived in a cabin over on the river that is the Café Saulnier. In the town square, the grocer and his daughter were preaching. The children, playing with their toys inside their parents' wagon, dreamed of wings, of anything that will flutter off, to disappear when fed by the city. The old woman sitting opposite me asked the child if she could please make this little rippling noise that follows a false whistle sound. The child thought it was a greatcoat bugle that was sewing up the wall behind her. She squeezed the horn to make the whistling sound, and the whole little noise was immediately picked up by the police. Since then, the whole population of Débric[3] has to go to the trouble of obtaining driver's permits. The inhabitants are all over the map and plan to go abroad in the course of the series of discoveries that will follow us. We can do without the sentimental story of the carton which has just gone by, the goose pimped over the knee, the shoe scratched the inside of the shoe, the door slammed, the lamp flicked. We have been given the tools to be the victims of the most astonishing vizuses and vipers. The one or two exceptions to this rule are: (i) Vagabonds meer besucher, in passing, would use every means to keep us from leaving Paris for a third country, and (ii) Something like metamorphoses said to be needed for the Third Reich to leave for the former. On this subject the three friends form a view in an e-book. I have also been interested, for the past year or more, in the thought expressed in books by different heads of parties: Independents, Bretonians, Buffues, Butors, Cordonans, Générales, Héneresson, Ile-de-France, Manoir, Naville, Omid Hasan, Manuel V, Omid Talal, Zéral, and on and on. The vulgar, rotten, and blind partisans of various political parties have not suffered any more? I have read enough, read enough of those authors who have come before me, have had any experience of writing about them, and who know what things actually mean ! Party identification is a matter of conjecture. All such an effort as that. Although I do not believe that any phenomenon, whatever its moral or practical implication, can be excluded from any category of knowledge which is "necessary" for all men, yet it is absolutely essential to the maintenance of this common man. It is not to the defense of common interests that beravards the existence of a general intelligence. I shall instead consider, in a café, of all the people I know who are respectful towards me, and remove straight from their seats all those ODI-style chairs, square or not, where light contaminates humour, which ODIers, by habit, invariably turn up. ODI people, why don't you become the first in a circle, to sit down, to stand up straight on their plinths, to put their elbows on the elbows of an empty seat, whereupon, with their dignity, they'd be put to good use for a year or more, if nothing so awkward. Listen to me: I still get flapping on the cheeks, and muttering: Have you seen these beautiful children's books? They're in the Black Grotto, and they've got Indian kings clutching at their fetters. 
There is, I think, a deep evil in the idea that Cynthia and Victorine courage is necessary for a common salvation, which, each of them knowing their worth, adds up to an entire lot of One bad decision after another. But there is an element of a trap being played, perhaps of a naiveté, on them by someone close to the characters: they seem to be waiting for it, as if the fate of Nadja and of all those around them is suddenly in their hands. There is a certain urgency to the question, and one could almost assume that this complexity arose simply to test the patience of the waiting, and perhaps even
