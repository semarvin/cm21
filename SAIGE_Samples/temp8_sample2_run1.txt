======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
In a sense I'm in love with that redheaded creature who sits at the foot of my bed and breathes me away. At one time it was a fern coloured pinky its colour of feverish folly. Now it's a pinky with a violet throat and a violet-coloured nose. She hangs her hair in both directions in a dishevelled bun. It's a long bun with white flaps between the sleeves and a long white oblong at the front. Finally each day she puts her hand on her shoulder and retches, trying to make her hear, she makes her way through the crowd of people who stare at her in silence. At night, as in the past, when she had to stay in a dark room and watched her from the shadows, when the only light came from a distant window, she dreamt of the time that she would have for sure not toil in the shadow of that tree with an eagle-winged white bird climbing on one end and an enormous serpent on the other. In the hope of saving her head, she dreamt of forcing open that little gap in the back of the room, but which, it turned out, was a very deep one. That was when the dove, having tried in vain to get hold of her, said to her: "I have long since passed the test of standing, that's right, fly on your knees, and believe me, I give you my whole heart and my whole soul for this sacrifice. I have never seen that look in a more person and this strength of belly, that belly of his, and here I am sharing in that miracle of yours." 
And, indeed, she would for years elapse see him no longer. In fact, after a thousand nights there was no longer to be any time for myself, for me to lie, and always lying. I no longer saw myself any more. There was no more sense in which I looked at myself, now, in a twisted way, there in that narrow alley that led to my window. Now, in the unfathomable silence of a loft above all places of spiritual experience, there was the right of way cut across the courtyard of the Gothic mansion, and I looked at him from there. 
Several centuries on, when I think back, to this day, I see this old, weary man walking along this boulevard that leads to my house, and it was an old, respected man who provided me with with a good steady supply of modern and popular news. My youth was thus continually informed by these rare but knowledgeable eyes, he did not have any doubts about my thinking, he simply about all thought. It was during that period that, during the debaucheries at my person, a certain fool who was his own defense, he, the father, betrayed his wife by believing that he paid the tithe of his son-in-law's high-oct 3, I think. The poor fool, thought he, paid the full tithe of his father’s war chest to the country estate where he and his little girl were staying, running around like normal human beings. This silly sentimental fool, thought he, was keeping his man at home as he went on about his presentings of his son-in-law, the husband’s future fiancée, and the miserly wife who was visiting him from out of state. Alas, that poor fool, thought he, had to go and support himself at home, and not to the most expensive school. When my youth recounted certain of the old tales the father had given him in the before-and- after years, this fool, thought he, would long to follow through on these lies. So then, when faced with the fact that my youth, in truth the Son of God, who was crowned with new clothes after the banquet, had at last abandoned the traditional ways of living, had to be decently dressed, and asked no better servant, no better companion, no better ear, would anyone ever again find the secret to taming the imbecilic sods of the modern world? I would gladly take another's place of any and sincere man in the most modern of gatherings, however fraternal or secular he may be, and none the less Catholic or not. I do not seek to dictate to him. But any conversion that he may provide me must then be his alone justification. And I shall do my very best to keep a close watch on this watch, even if it means betraying nothing.
No matter how lightly I coughed him, no matter how infrequently he spoke, no matter how apologetic he was, no matter how unkind he was to me, I would not let him down. He was caring, loving, even arrogant, one evening I sits beside him while we walk along the quays, and I feel the head of a slovenly, nervous young man slip over mine. And I tell myself nothing more of my marvelous lies, of my
