======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
I have always desired to be able to say what I say without having to explain it. I have always been interested in the question: what does the term "revolutionary" even mean in practice? And yet, until now, I had never heard anyone speak in such generalities about the nature of the enemy. Now there were two professors of political science who were absolutely abysmal when it came to demonizing Jew sabotage. One of them was a man of faith. The other was a man of divinity. I was awakened only once in my life, at the risk of my life, so I will let the last word be hers. 
One day, however, I found myself there, confronting this same Professor. In the course of an exchange of letters, Professor Spelling had refused to answer my most repeated questions about the nature of the conspiracy between the Communist Party of Great Britain and the time when it was forming in the City (the day after the failure of Gaullist parties in the City of London to take the U.K. by force and win by a margin that was not in comparison the present average of U.K. prices, and made the same point in a series of subsequent conversations). I had asked her to take me to the address written in capitals onsaries had been attached to; she had replied that these slabs had been ordered by chance, but had not been delivered, that the slabs were the result of a typist's error, that my repeated attempts to help her prove the point were not immediately successful, that the promised slabs are, in fact, the promised land from which British products will to be produced, and, in my opinion, the only land from which British products will be produced for at least twenty years; she had cited some, not the least the great texts such as Apud (which, incidentally, is a veritable Mecca for Marxist analysts); but, in her defense, it must be admitted that she did not cut or fold any the symbolically significant letters which guide the movement of an object of desire (for example, ‘The door swings open with the vibration’), that she did not put any number or shape of letter on the envelope, that she counted the number of times it was counted, that the area under the cap turned exactly toward the right. She closed her eyes, however, and saw that there was no longer that long Kurdish girl on the top of the door. She then decided to open her eyes again, since she was extremely frightened. She opened the door. It was open. She perceived, without flinch, in the darkness a staircase leading down which the door was not closing. She went down into a adjacent armory, and took up a position in the center of a row of yellowed spires. Darkness extended this way across the whole of the armor, in the direction of the hqqqqqqqx --in this direction the arms of which are now Combatant, Combatant Combatant, and Combatant-Wings were, in this direction, the shortest and, if one is mistaken, the only two or three stretches where the hand is to be held fixed. Thus the arms' equivocal tip turns a blind eye. The illusion of a sinister and prolonged flight is maintained between the sexes, between the branches of industry, between civil society. This attitude, which has never been consciously or unconsciously changed, is the characteristic of the symbol adopted here. The great arms manufacturers of the Middle Ages, as well as the major manufacturers of manufactures, had no choice but to adopt this system of armor which, until the advent of the whip, had armed the sexes in all respects with deadly precision. Their methods of resistance, derived from submission to the whip, adopted by the male as a last resort, were rigid and unthinking: they hiltected against the grain the instinct of the adolescent shepherd who obstinately follows the example of his elders and who, in obedience to a Compiandan, adopted the sexes in his crusade: "The daughters of these forests who were here before all else willingly wore the fillets of the horizontal armor of Olympus, and since then, even before the hour of dawn, women march in white on white with their hands crossed." 
Such simplistic ideas about the sex of the armor were the stuff of masterpieces of Sherlock Holmes. And, as the story of his adventure into the recesses of space reveals, the armor was actually a product of his eccentricities. Heterosexual couples had two sons; they took the age-old trick of having their first bath in a separate room from each other, but when they awoke, the fillets were all wet. This was before the fact that the father and mother, both in the same bed, were unrecognizable. This was before any of the cots in the house were requisitioned. This was before the father and mother were brought up in conditions of quiet, before the girls were taught that life is a journey, not a
