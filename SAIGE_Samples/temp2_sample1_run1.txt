======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
I have always loved to hear the parricide of the most important facts. It was in love that I was most obliged to return home, to a country country where I alone can now offer you my life, your tears, your tender cries, your tender pennants. The only thing I would add to your wretched eyes, those are all that remain of humanity, decency, and the most important instinct in your lips. I would also add that I do not repudiate those who, when confronted by you, willingly renounce the means of exaltation that are the fruit of a lifetime of virtue, of a bliss so much more precious than that of life itself. You are not depreciating my own in any respect, and yet you insist on being utterly incapable of seeing that I have no limits on our relationship. I have the impression of your great-aunt occasionally making eye contact with you on the porterhouse sofa. I can see it from his eyes as well. He is the type of people who habitually stops short of giving you a hint as to the kind of adventure to expect. You are the type of adventure that can be had in the shadow of the mountains, in the shadow of the rivers, in the shadow of forests. I have always, without objection, heard you tell the funny story of how, up a mountain of ancient antiquity, men brought their dogs together in one hut. After a game of trickery, the newlyweds noticed that the huskies were barkingle-rattling all the time, and decided to bring the situation to them. They thus came to me. The day before my daughter's wedding, I had gone to her flat, which was called The Bataclan, so that my wife and I could enjoy a tranquil end. I was quite taken with the place we were in that evening bemusedly called "The Bataclan" (which, as I went on to describe it, was no flotilla) and anxious to get a grip on the reality of what was to become of our beloved "The Magnificent Mac-Loufs." We were unable to leave the flat, which was becoming increasingly dark, so we could not be sure which of the doors or the upper stories was where we were going. We made steady use of the tip of a cane, who was very kindly to us. We made steady use of the tip of a cane, who was very kindly to us. We made a mental note to ourselves before proceeding; otherwise, if one were to attempt to explain the disquieting silence surrounding the place of departure, he would be deeply irritated. We could say nothing for certain about his future intentions until we left, but in this instance he made us feel at the very moment when our salvation depended upon it. 
We left without further delay, the door open for us.

"What time is it here?" 
"It's at the window of the hotel where we are staying."
"And it is at the window of the hotel?"

"It's better to stay here with someone who knows the ground. The streets are long, and the air is more welcoming."

"The best thing about traveling on a farm is the freedom that keeps on taking me by the hand. The freedom of never looking back, the freedom of never being afraid. Looking back, I know you. Of never being afraid, of never letting go. Of never letting go of what you love, whatever it is that takes you by the hand is at the very heart of my strength and my grace. Look at this beautiful woman. She is nowhere in the world that I love, somewhere in the world that you remind me of everything that makes her, what with the long, drawn out journey, the road that takes her wherever she goes, she finally makes up the square of our country and we are going to the sea, the square where the great grass-trenches are, the square in which I am the only one who doesn't want to go, where for all my love for the world and the square in which you remind me of everything that makes you change one day to be happy, changed again to what? butterflies? in the square, you get the feeling that your hand is always with you, that your hand always is with her. I am always ready to lend a hand, lend her a price, if she will, the feeling of the whole of human patience, the feeling of the whole of human concern for you, and of the whole of human indifference, for you, as the coat of your hand, your own hand, to take one of your skins, the whole of humanity, before long, will agree with you that I am, are not only so, but also, your soul knows how I know, too.
