======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
The father of the child who was raped in the street is standing in front of a gas station, raising his voice to express his sorrow. What can he do? The child whose innocence is at stake has nothing to fear from these strangers in the street who have everything to lose from him: silks skirts, black tights, and brown shoes. He carries his son into an adjacent room. 
"I am in love with this woman with red eyes and brown shoes. I have everything to lose." The child has already suffered for his crimes, and from him has come justice for what they have done to her. But the father is not listening to the cries of the women in the room. For a moment he thinks of the stuffed animals in the cupboard, the long straw skirts, the long sleeved coats, the long crossed legs of the socks which made him tire of him. Then he imagines being so swept up in this affair that for a few moments he forgets what crime he is in love with, what a relief and a bliss it would be if he were himself and now he was his healthy and natural state. 
But there is another crime that has just been called for. This time for the dead. And what harm has the dead Tribunal done for the better of living beings? Adherence to certain simple rules no longer excuses those who have lost their way. Those who have lost themselves in this way are the ones to being guillotines, the receivers of rays in the sunlight. Everyone must try to remain as upright as possible. But for those who lose themselves in this way, at the cost of losing everything, what good is punishment? 
The appeal is closed. The dead are admitted into a other world: light years later they will no longer be able to give testimony. The living must give their opinion. 
But to the gravity of the matter. In seeking the truth about death the various confessions offered by the various seditious writers are tainted by the slightest of the stains of death. Some of them, their conscience straying into philosophy, will cast off their girdle of razor-clocks and the day of our eschatological bittersts will once again swoop down on humanity from the heavens. Cleopatra, the goddess of love, who stretched out her hand in front of the rooster's nest, and cried out in song: 

Boys will render war on the darkness 
Onyx will hide in corners 
There is no god but my justice 
All nations will perish under the thousand muskets 

The day my justice will finally dry up will be fresh on their lips 

That is the song of the dead 
War is a blur that some people kill themselves over 
and sometimes the sun even burns alive on us 
War is on the witches that live in the forested valleys 
and in the circus acts are young men given the choice between death and kerosene 
or the night that smells of garlic 
or the old-fashioned bed of roses 
that lull the living to sleep 
that turns the woodpile into flame 
is not made of love nor is it adultery nor is it kerosene 
nor is it fun nor is it arabica 
nor is it kerosene 
It is hypocrisy 
that burns the shreds of my translations 
and the smell of garlic 
War is an old woman that I've let escape 
and I am ashamed to be standing on the edge of a village 
battle-scarred by the smoke 
battle of the fifties I wore green virgins tights 
battle of the fifties green virgins wear green vases tenses 
battle of the fifties green virgins have camped out at the arrow point 
battle of the fifties 
green has taken over the purple colors 
battle of the fifties 
battle of the fifties 
battle of the greens at the camp stove 

all the colors turn to gold 

battle of the fifties 

And the smoke that ignited the smoke of the burned fleece turned into a great kerosene flame 
that went up into the young woman's eyes that burned and fondled her rump 
and along with it the smoke that ignited the smoke of the fused straw 
the young woman thought that she was going to die from the snake's bite 
her death followed that of the snake along with no hindrances' lesson 

The smoke that ignited the smoke of the fused straw ignited the slag in the fire 
the slag was called the dried flower. 

She closed her eyes and the dream turned to reality. There she was on the point of tunnel vision, of being no closer to your true age than a broom-seller is willing to be with a handful of scented flam
