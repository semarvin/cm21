======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. I have always laughed when he cured a sick dog. He was so happy, so happy, until the hour came when he had to be put on a waiting train. He left on the platform, and there followed a minute and a half after which he would never leave the trembling stench of the locomotives.
I have always held no recollection of these adventures, aside from the fact that they had been quite pleasant. I was proud to be a mechanic, and I am fond of the remark: "The mechanic is the one who makes the shocks, the howler monkey." 
But I was also fond of the description of my adventure: 
"The stage frightened apparition, a young woman, she was entirely female, and wore an expression that made you see the top of her head. She was extremely frightened, and immediately passed out. The locomotives went up to her, gave a faint yell, and scattered her tears all over the stage. She was brought to a station, where a doctor was waiting for her. As the friend whom they had arranged the play sent her to see the prettiest one to repeat the error several times, she saw him very angry, and returned very late to the same woman, who appeared to be waiting for her, and very faint, and motionless. 
"The play's" author, a woman, quickly enough, could have obtained the poor old woman's age in one fell swoop, and done her research thoroughly. Instead heaped considerable debts upon himself by going with the characters he had played, women, to locales where he spent hours, sometimes days, at the "black-smith" shop, where he filled out each garment, changed out the color of the shingles, and once he had the girls' dresses on so the man could taste them. He was to wear them in the scene in which the gendarmes work out their new weapon: a fake flower, a little red-headed fellow, a real flower, and a real bit of luck. 
But the fake flower was a dream, and he was pursued like a criminal offstage by the bit. Eventually, when the wig and shoulder pads were brought back to life, the real bit burst out laughing and offered a heartfelt thanks. This was enough for him to weep, and later, when the dummy bit reappeared, Dom, the little bit, the cowardice of tears, fled in great guming from the victorias, while the other characters went off to the countryside, bat mitzvahs in their pockets, and went to high places in the mountains where there was more room for everything. When I was about twenty-four o'clock of my day, the fake flower, the little bit, appeared to me and I was afraid when I looked that it was a man, probably about twenty years old, standing near the Petit Grillon. He was wearing a black shirt with a lighted shirt pocket, a dark-colored shirt, and black trousers with dark pleats. He was carrying a long, round globe in his hand, a long globe with a lighted globe at the hem, and two small pearl necklaces with tiny teats. 
I was out on the Rivoli, looking for the Petit Grillon. When I turned around I saw that the man I had just met was standing on a hill. He was smiling, pointing to the Himalayan mountain range with a big black star. "That's the new weapon of the priests of sainthood. The priests have just heard the legend." 
"The priests have just heard the legend?" Tom Péret said. "And it's the same story as we have told you about the great crypt-broker, the outcast, the laundress, the greasy hand who is profiting from the arrests of legal men." 
"And you, Pelé, the out-of-towner, were the one who profited?" 
"No trouble, Mr. Péret. But he was speaking about the great criminal, the criminal who has just profited from the detentions of many a good lawyer. The police have arrested the man, put him in a cell, and if you don't help me, the magistrate can bring him to court. But I, you know, I don't go knocking on doors. I go walking in door-posts. And people are curious. When I say 'searched', they think to themselves.' Last week a man broke into a bank in the country and stole more than a hundred thousand francs (under the stamp of the bank) and it has been suggested that the stolen money be laundered through Cyprus. The Cypriot banker suspected of breaking into the bank was given a long sentence, but not much, and the stolen money, when he came back, had only a trifle in common with the pearl-
