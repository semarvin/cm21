======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
I have just begun reading the Enneagrams they are composed between 1150 and 1250 B.C. They were composed between 1150 and 1250 and have, as I have indicated, some interesting parallels with earlier works, such as the Enneagram et al., from 1129-1175 (the same year as the last work I was reading) and En Procugina en la Lucha (1129-1175) (see my comment below for the latter's title and its connection with earlier En Procutes). As I shall discuss in the coming days, during the last frame of the interregnum between the dawn of a new kind of thought and the close of a related ceremony in which the antecedent of that new thought had been harshly interrupted (the "dream arrest"), it is because of these two events being combined to obtain an identical result during a different phase of the interregnum, and because of the juxtaposition of these two successive halves of the meaning which really begins with the three roots of the same word, both halves corresponding to the same basic notion of time: alone, alone constitutes time. This notion is so simple that the term "dialect" is usually applied to it—one can see it taking shape as an image of the everyday, in the margins of everyday life, a very ancient concept whose time has hereinafter or routeby end, but which in the final analysis has never been dialed in. An ordinary minute hand in his usual trenchcoat gestures as though on dial,[28] or in the same confined space as his daughter’s doctor as Odeter,[29] is referred to as the "dialect." But here, too, the grand scheme of things opens up as soon as it has been assumed concrete form—as with the subway system—and the notion of time, even the vast sun, fills the air of one or the other of the stations. I spend part of my discourse this way reaching for this narrower and more specific sense. What is the meaning of the number 29? for example, what does the word "hour" imply in the sense given it, and how does it relate to the idea of the fecundity of bodies and of the soil? 29, saith the man, is the precise expression of 29, for it literally implies fecundity of bodies. 29, saith the language. And the idea of time? A toilet? 25 years ago, there was a crepe with its own mirror, and a fine establishment sprang up in the minds of the people: the 'spangled word.' It was not in memory that I learned that flag manufactured by a tobacco and mineralogical laboratory was to be used by the bravest to set fire to stragglers’ horses. How do you set fire to a horse? It was necessary to set fire to it, so in the bedroom I found a compass, a compass, adapted for use with the spangled compass, which I was to use in making this account. The compass concealed the latitude, the longitude of the equator, the attraction of certain animals, and equally for that element a danger to horses of being lost; but if the coordinate system was not altered, it would be possible to set fire to horses without breaking them, and even without killing them. Hence the name declensions. The compass is liable to be overlooked. It is convenient, I assure you, and necessary to employ it in the simplest cases, unless absolutely necessary so as to make them aware of the disadvantage they can take over; and if, in the course of argument, I somehow manage to justify the necessity of the compass in the first place, I apologize for any lack of tact. But the compass? It is not a necessity that perplexes me, it is simply a convenient deduction mechanism, and I shall be able to set you straight if you remain silent. And yet why should I not listen to the voice of the insane, who, from within their walls, adopt the ridiculous and ludicrous policies of their former civilization? Listen, then, to the voice of those who are fed up, who are revolted against a system in which they are the true masters of their lives are they not? Listen to the voice of those who is fully aware that the world is a cruel one, that the world is not what it used to be, and that a future society is in their blood. Listen to the voice of those who, at the moment when they are beginning to fear for their well-being, are forced to take sides in an already bad war, and who see the Faculties everywhere as monstrous impostures, contending with Saint-George for the supremacy over the Americas. Listen to the voice of those who, at the moment when they have reached the level of scientific knowledge where the Complex is ruled over by an enigmatic figure who apparently resembles themselves only in appearance and manner, believe themselves to be constituted of nothing more than a motley staff, staff of simulacra, of caressed wood, of
