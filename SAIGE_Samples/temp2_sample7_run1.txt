======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. The most famous of these is that of Roquefort, who, on the edge of a journey through the Amazon, found himself sucked into a machine whose fumes and dust he could no longer exhale, and who, unable to get off the plane again, found himself obliged to put his hands on his knees before a mirror in order to confirm his initial belief that the sky is a vast blue drum. The tales he had heard were too touching to refuse, and he was so moved by that, that he decided to tell my mother about those miraculous machines he has never tried. This machine which allowed him to look at himself in his mirror and said to himself: I am a machine of the universe. It was as though I could take a walk in the far reaches of this marvelous jungle and see the flowers growing in every corner. 
The American woman of the '70s, when she was asked to describe a representation of the miracle, replied: Of all the divinities, this is the person whose image will reproduce, remembered and whose part he will play in the tragedy to come. She was so determined to produce a work as touching, so determined herself to complete with an amusing book of conjectural observations, that shead of mice, which sealed the deal. She lived by the sad, the insipid stories: shenequins, the cats in the pictures, the flights of stairs and windows opening up at the back, the way, in the '70s, boys on the go, the use of confectioners, of course, which made the fabulous naive, the worthless, and the worthless will never again forget this reassuring story. She closed her eyelids one after the other, leaned on a switch, and took in the world in her free eyes. She never dreamed of transcending the glass, of following the rule of chance, of following the straight lines of which reason alone knows no theerest. She saw the miracle as a certain need, a need of the Negro, of a Negro who could not read, and who did not have a written word. She saw him as a symbol of everything that was, was not simply meaningless in the modern sense of the word, but literally fatal to any hope of becoming a woman: "If you knew in your heart of gold that you were going to die without ever having felt so alone any more, you would imagine that for the first time in your life you were going to have a woman of color, a woman of color without ever being alone."

Another woman, the mother, the grandmother, the grandmother of the great swathe of the U.S.A. population, was the most powerful, if a tragically obscure, representative of this dying word. I was growing old, I was thinking of my great-aunt, the grandmother. 
Multicolored, multicolored, multicolored. I could have left her, of course, but I chose the far, far more satisfying, and more beautiful, the far eastern one, which was as far as the Mac-Loufs and the Bolivars were from here, as far as the neighborhood is concerned, and farther still as far as the grandfather is from here, as far as the brother from here is from here, as far as the aunt from here is from here; from there the mother one, the grandmother one, the grandfather one. 
The name Negro, the mother, the grandmother, the Negro, the Negro, the Negro, the father, the father, the grandfather, the grandfather, the grandfatherâ€”had been forgotten in the minutes of my life when my mother, in choosing a name that did not clash with any that I cherished, chosen with the background of his or her own life, and when, in the course of years to come, she chose a name that echoed her joy, the joy of the complete disappearance of her, and when, in the course of years to come, she chose a name that echoed her disappointment, the disappointment of the fact that life was not always so beautiful, that life was not always so beautiful, and that there were always those who still did not know what was called beauty. 
In the last analysis, there were two realities I lived in common with during the last thirty years: a reality I know named Mar- Roule, and an imaginary one named Arrigoni, for whom I have always, and without the slightest hesitation, attributed the privilege of being alive. 
Neither of us was born with a reality, a fact or an imaginary. I was born with a reality, and an imaginary with which I have always converseed. I am, however, aware of the harm that lies ahead for me, and the need for ever-increasing awareness in order to give back, in the process of renouncing my former identity, what is lost, what gains the search for knowledge has saved, and in order that truth, in all
