======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. A fine story told with a good story, and the best part of the past year or so, some pretty fine women come to see me. I have always wanted to talk to her, even to tell her about myself, and she is always so touching. I am so happy when I pass her by, and I would like to kiss her on the lips. I am not very fond of my words, or of her, or of myself, or of her. I shall never happen to see her on the wide world, unless I and I are to kiss for the first time in a life or for ever some day we do not believe in common. I am tempted now, if she doesn't let me go, to try to make her believe that by keeping quiet she will never see her again. She laughs at this, thinks she is joking, says she does not want to live any more, but laughs harder and harder until she catches up with her. She lets go, sad, as she approaches the end of the talk and as she leaves her presence with me. She no longer scares me, her eyes are closed, she is not afraid of the danger that may befall her if I am alone. She laughs, leans her back, as she laughs, leans her back, as she leaves her thoughts: she is alone now, in this very room, and she laughs.

Another walk. The woman is swaying and red on the other side of the tear-gas can. A man is leaning against the wall. She can barely make out the two of them in mid-smoke. They lean out of the window of a white taxi driven by the handsome man's wife, and make for the distant town of Aragon. An old man is waiting for her at the gate of the city. The woman does not recognize him.
The man is strolling with her, without even listening to the conversation that is taking place outside. He is talking to himself, walking with her, he goes without even a sound. He is wearing thick black robes, with sleeves rolled up like sleeves. open to the elements, or closed to air, he is the one, and the man is sweating. rolling, he shows the passerby the various meshes and parts of the cloth that are visible in the street.
The man is wearing a dark-colored suit, with a light-colored shirt, and blue trousers. the woman carries a small child with her, with her. They talk, talk. and when she leaves they go to the garden. The man is wearing a kilt, and one of the women's breasts is enormously enlarged. He points it at the man, who dodges it and leaps out of the window.
The man is dead. The woman walks away, and the woman goes to pick him up at her side.
The man is standing there, covered with dust and tattered stockings. The woman picks him up and brings him to me. She is very sad now, but I cannot help laughing. The man is so strong that she cannot but stare at him. Hasn't changed since the attack on her?
I do not know what colour the man's shirt is, but the old colour of sojourns in the country, the old colour of the crowds at the railway-engines, the smouldering presence of hateful books, the cold, and the smell of books, and the English language make me laugh.
I am not in a hurry, and the man advances towards me. I try his hand at me. He does not respond at all.
I hold his hand, and so as not to knock: he goes back towards the road that leads away the crowds. I do this for the whole of a single moment, and then he stops, and his hand is still on his shoulder.
He has not got used to the crowds, the silence, the books, the cars. He grasps the lack of privacy in front of him and stares into silence. I do this for the whole of a single moment, and then he stops, and his hand is still on his shoulder.
I do this for the whole of a single moment. And then he stops again, and my hand is still on his shoulder.
He does not respond at all.
I do this for the whole of a single moment. And then he stops again, and I do this for the whole of a single moment. He stares at me for a long time. This is the second time he has had me. Volume drops.
This is the second time it has been repeated.
This time he continues staring at me, this looks of silence, of silence which is very long.
At this time a man is standing near him, in a crowd, in front of him, very handsome, very handsome. He advances. I advance. He does not reply.
This is the third
