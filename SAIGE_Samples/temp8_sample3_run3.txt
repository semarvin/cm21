======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
The man with the long beard whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg with his bare right hand and whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg with his index finger. The grass has never spanned its entire right side. 
He stretched it so thin that his fingers were left-aligned. The man who stretched it so thin that his fingers were left-aligned with the grain of grass. 
But at that moment a large cloud, vaguely reminiscent of a surfboard with two surfboards at its sides, approached. The man with the long beard whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg. The grass has never spanned its entire right side. 
A wave lifted him up. He could still hear the surfboard song, but he couldn't make out what it was like. 
The man with the beard was listening to the battle of the gardens in the distance with his head glued to the screen. The grass has never spanned its entire right side. 
He watched as the clouds rose, descended, descended again, like two phalluses. 
The Wave lifted him up. He let out a long sigh and let out a light sigh as it settled on the ground. 
The Wave disappeared. The man with the long beard whose beard he stretched it like a sprinter's leg with his bare right hand was concentrating on his pupil and his eyes were filled with the very thought of danger. He was concentrating his attention on the pupil of his pupil. He could clearly see from the pupil that the horizon was bothering him. He got up and got out his arm to the left, where was the wave? The man with the beard was concentrating on his eye and his pupil. 
The wave skimmed by and came to rest against the clouds. The horizon was bothering him. He got up and got his arm out. 
The waves made their reappearance about two in the morning. Feeling it poking through the clouds, the man stopped, his eyes wide open. The sea! Was it the sun? The sea? 
He tried to conjure up this thought in his head a long time ago. But he was prevented from doing so by the sound of a boat: the wind had broken his nose, which was by now very much spayed andneved. But after a moment's reflection the seawater soundlessly healed him of his weariness for ever. Feeling the wave relaxing in his nostrils, the man let himself go. He perceived the wave gently snip littering the water, and the later waves as well, but in exactly the same places and with the same volume. His eyes were filled with tears. And he shed tears with shame: and thought perhaps for a moment that this great wave was shedding its shadow, that while some were rubbing their hands over its swollen regions, others were budding palms (to the dismay of sailors who were fishing for fish), others were brushing distant roots with their teeth, others were cradling youngwith bearded heads, others were gobbling up intellectual property: one, who was fishing for gold, had been awarded the coveted title to the Seine-et-join, while the other, an apprentice, had found a wooden hook which helped her catch fish. The man with the long beard, the Wave, the sailor, the cloud and the wind: all these men, when confronted with the characteristics of a Being who could be anything but abstract, devoid of forms or of a single idea, no less than the Wave, the Wave alone, the Wave alone could not eliminate unprofitable paths. They took the Wave, Wave without the Wave, Wave possessing the Wave. The highwayman of the sailors begs to differ. He says: "I only wish I knew the formula for a river flow like an olive branch." 
But the Wave is not the Wave. The olive branch is not the Wave. 
The Wave is the Knowledge that is the Knowledge-maker. The Wave is my gateway. 
I am the Wardrobe at bat. I use the rectangle to describe a sky of whiteness 
drawn by the winds, by those who divide the sun into rays 
drawn by the fire, by those who cannot see anything but the whitest 
of the veils their skins invade the face of the earth. 

The sun is not the bearer of darkness. 

My womb was the Wardrobe. 

She was at one with the world. 

She opened the door that shuts in my presence. She closed it very slowly, as a safeguard. She smiled, murmured, took pains to direct her words, she liked the distraction of the world, the distraction of the little, tired little ones, on the walk up to the window, which closed in front of her. The world bathed in her shadow, bobbing in a ball of flame.
I am the dawn. 


I have passed the battlefield. I have passed
