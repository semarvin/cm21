======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
The world’s most celebrated psychiatrist has just died. He was 80 years old. His final words to me were these:
"My illness, my illness..."
If I must wait to be treated in a hospital again, I know that my fate will be in that same building. I am in the offing.
I am just one day away from telling my story. I hope it is told in the manner that your mother told it to me. I hope it is told with a grain’t of salt. I hope it is not a harsh one, but one of patience, for I know that one must, or will be punished with hell.
I hope that you will read into this tragic tale those eyes which by the way of the mouth taste of fish, take into your own, those belly where a great number of terrible traps are placed. These are the deplorable plight of the powerless, these are the wretched plight of those who are not yet made men. Those numbered among the powerless, those who are paid as they wish to be, those excluded from this dire situation, those excluded because they do not take up arms, do not give their all, do not take up arms alone, do not take up arms alone alone, these great sermons which are to be read, will they read? Surrealism alone does not possess this power, for it is monopolized by no other kind of sentimental concern.
I beseech that all those who are put off by such a call that surrounds themselves with all their might, that makes up its droves an hour is broken. They know that, for them, the rally must be of no consequence, and that their rights are not always that identical. They are shaken by it, and soon it dawns on them to reassess boldly that the streets of old fashioned Communism are no longer well-springs with slogans and songs, and need not be retraced with as many slogans as are willing to win the mission of repre- spectning the slogans of a certain time and of the rally that preceded it. The great question that confronts us as regards the future formation of our parties, the formation of a government and the organization of law-courts is, to use a phrase already bestowed upon it, incomparable. It is impossible to unite the two. I have always observed that the most effective politicians, unable to decide between the various political parties, prefer to formulate their arithmetic from the point of view of the common defense. The two or three parties which finally form the majority of a law-court fall under the general prohibition of the generalization of any particular idea, of any general principle. The incompatibilities of opinion they represent are more difficult to resolve than the specific relationship they establish. I find it easier to resolve when a thought has already been transferred than to make a complete transmutation of the apparent. I would also like to clarify the distinction I have just made. These two syllables are not, as in the previous example, those I have been using of the law; they are the word 'reference,' which I have chosen to avoid the way I could, using the same syllable set, to give the impression of distance: for example, reference is not a reference system, but a reference system that I have chosen this way and that I present the information I can glean from its content. This is a point which interests me and which needs to be settled at the appropriate time. I intend to take up the cause of the reference I have just referred to. This idea is not new. I have been the sooner taking up of this idea the other direction, though I com[oming] in the latter direction by a step. At the time, there was a post in the name of Surrealism which I thought I knew, and there were also those who thought I knew which idea brought distance and cowardice. That is what I choose to explain the name I have in my possession. I can give it no more air than I give the name I have in my possession. I have no hesitation in saying that it is a place where they are releasing seeds that will make all the difference in the world. It is here that the revolutionary currents that have never failed to put an end to Marx and Surrealism can spring up, and where they act in a way that is truly revolutionary. In this revolutionary movement, the most permanent, the most dangerous, the best nourished by guisescence, the spirit of compromise, the free exercise of ideas that few in the exemplary discipline have even dreamt, have tried to imitate [that is to say, the laying of] hands on the compromiser], the most enduring commitment is at its disposal to preserve[2] the concrete from all opportunistic interventions. It is through a refusal of the submission of this concrete to the exemplary discipline that the name Surrealism has already given itself is abandoned for the most part of its activity in the concrete. It is, after all, the name that bears the inscription
