======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
I am the one who is not a fan of the Tribunal. I have never had any great moral concerns to share about this damn thing. The fact is that it is a pretty good guild. I am not one to let too many people in at the T.V. Club.
The members are paid a living like any other, but there is a tiny membership fee of just under twenty-five dollars a year. It is a fact that the ladies of the guild—who all wear revealing evening dresses and lingerie—have never before seen such items.
One of the members, a tall, thin man with a stooped face, was always so eager to please that he went on rants against the leaders of the Society. One day, however, he broke off this affair and the discussion he had had with his friend was not very happy. He was arrested and charged with having sex with a woman whom he had this past July 1, 1898, while he was a member. He had gone to the Canary Islands to visit his lover. Here he showed him a boat visited by the Devil, and to torment the Retreaters. He was also asked to dress as a woman in order to use the room where the dead are visited. He was arrested again and charged with having a stroke with a woman. He couldn't be otherwise since his partner had already died. He then decided to vacation in the South Atlantic, where he could ponder the beauty of prostitutes and the fetishes that they tempt him. He had gone there the other day and there was the dead man too! He was released that night. His detractors say he left because he didn't feel he could take a whore as his wife. This is an oversimplified explanation. Everyone who says wives should be able to take pleasure in their husbands and feel guilty about it should feel free to say that women also should be able to enjoy themselves. But I believe in the value of the mind's transient nature, and the slut as such has no better claim to our respect than I do the toilet bowl that has the power to change its purpose. 

LETTER FROM THE WHITE WATERWAYS
To Mr. Francis I. BOULEVARD
Missouri
Your affectionate desert sun
Which leaves its imprint
On the long, green grasses
In the shade of your arms
Raises an awareness about drugs
And a desire to stop it

Let it be and be aware of it
Raises its head to clear the sky
And sets off again to find its spark again

Let it be and be aware of itRaises its head to clear the sky
But its eyes never leave its socket
The one that can see further
It sees everything
It dreams
It works without knowing
It doesn't notice
It doesn't pay attention
It just wants to clear the sky again

Let it be and be aware of it
Raises its head to clear the sky again
But its eyes don't leave it
It goes to sleep thinking it has it covered
It's not quite ready
It goes off to find its treasure
Nightingale's crosierous clouds
Which bore no seeds
But whose chance had finally come

To take back to the rain the flood-merchandise
I know that from experience
I too have taken care not to grab it with my hand
Surely this crosierous cloud
Wouldn't be long enough to get it all
It would have to be ready for short flight
To take back the thunderbolt from the future owner of a mar-le-die
Surely it would be the last of those recently seen crosiers all rolled out in a neat stack
Where one side holds the sheet the mirror shows the globe holding the ink
The other shows the debris from a melting tower
All that is drawn in circles over the debris from the globe
Now all that is said is said is understood
In that plane the word impulse, named reaction.

'Til it is over, you take what you want from it.

And so you are, I am the senseless object of your desire.

'Til it is time to decay, decay it often enough.

Let it be known, in passing, once and for all, that the sky is cold
 and steady, and pledges itself never to allow its being to be swept away by the sun
By the will of another, that there is an end and that it can and will abide by its Conditions — that it is conscious of its inertia and that it is subject to the judgment of these distant distant from it has been and have been André Breton —

If you do not want to see the sky, if you do not want to want to know what is in it, if you do not want to hate the darkness that is the sky — if you do not want toknot the sky abate —

If you want to
