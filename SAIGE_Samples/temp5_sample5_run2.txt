======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
I have spent a great deal of time in these last few days, in the vicinity of the park where I was presentable. Here are the main points of departure: Paris, Bordeaux; (René) Meaux; (Georges) Paris; (André) Paris; (And Villette) Bordeaux; (And Ingeine) Bordeaux; (And Guienne) Paris. Then there is Bordeaux; (And And André) Paris; (And And Valletta) Paris; (And And Neuilly) Paris. And here is where I am just now stopping at the entrance of the Rue Lafayette, when in the fury of a long Himalayan lightning chain I can feel the relentless heat of the fury of a forest—on my right, in the heart of the reservoir where I sat, cursing the absence of water in the windows and the distant murmur of cages and lakes. 
I am not alone in my regard: others have done just as I do and more; but there are those, who have only to recite the specific chronologies and calculations which permit them to design and construct such a system, and which will permit them to build a moat on the banks of rivers which are not rivers but reservoirs which can never be built. 
Those who are in the grip of what I am about to say must understand me by this very fact, that they have committed a mortal sin of jealousy: they have believed in by no means vague the thought of our seeking the forgiveness of God. I have believed, I believe now, in the infamy that was the apostolic life. In it, one had the better to submit, to submit in search of the Gospel. The faithful could have sworn that Paul the evangelist saw himself to be the first to condemn to death whoever displeases God and does not commend himself to be the first to praise the exaltation that is our flock and that is herded into the pasture. But it is through the hypocrisy of expecting to crush the vipers before one's name. And the name that one breathes, that beautiful voice, without pity for those who do not yet know what it means to be born again, is the same as it is for all those who remind us of God by the faithful's diligence: St. John of the Cross. 
Those who do not believe in the cross who watches over his flock with little and sundry hiccups. But the real king. sows wheat. The poor shepherd, who has been deprived of the green light of the preacher, must bandy his thanks in the open air.

If anyone asks me to clarify the present situation in chemistry, I am more than ever in a hurry. I am forced to by the fear of mosquitoes which grips me more acutely than any of the supernatural episodes which blight my youth. I can never keep up with the news, the letters, the avalanches in the street. I have been obliged to write: I cannot in good conscience explain myself: it is too late. I must call upon my friends, my family, the shopkeepers: it is asking too much for me to consider it a burden to speak out. 
I am in a state of shock. I have barely opened my mouth when a flood of words, each good for the soul and good for the town, throws down a wall and breaks it. A river of innuendo showering me with boiling vitriol. I am called upon to speak out: it is serpentine, it is forebodilyistic to speak out against it. 
I have been accused of having a personal affair with a 15 year old boy. The accusation is easily proved: I was in the room! the boy was naked! I know all about this! I even produced him! But the priest was absent. I cried my soul to him and asked him all the questions that I could. Finally, he gave in to his desires and led me to the bedroom where I had sex with a 15 year old boy. A priest. Ach, at least he wasn't too drunk. Calm yourself: it was just a sin."

No one has ever claimed that the senses are "all that are breathed." I had thus far been unable to explain my conception of smell, which has still not been satisfactorily articulated. I have always conceived it as a series of smells: the rich vegetal note heard here in barber-shops, the seductive perfume of the meerschaum-parlays room. I have therefore conceived it as a series of odours: they are the same in all men, my friend smell. And I have always conceived of smell as a duality: each possessing something unique for my perception and others. So my conception of smell stems from a duality of breath : for me it is a duality that is breath. And so I was thus thus unable to explain the absence of
