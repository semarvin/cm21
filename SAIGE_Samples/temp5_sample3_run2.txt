======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
There are two or three reasons why the most experienced and devoted fans of Marvel's The Avengers would not go out of their way to try and kill each other. The first is that, like Captain America, they love to compete. But they also love to compete on a huge and gratifying level. They are the savants of the universe. And they are relentless. I have never seen such a determined and devoted lover on display in my life-like time. This same fan, however, was out there killing people when he was a child. He is still angry, and he threatens me. He threatens to take my daughter to the island. He is a murderer. I have seen him die. I have tried to save her. But he is so weak, so withdrawn, that I am forced to move my hands so that he holds them for me. I have cried out against his stupid behavior. I have laughed in his face, over and over again, but I have never succeeded in making him move his head so that I can see his eyes. I have fond seen him dozes off. I have drunk in his presence all those famous and obscure drinks, and I have seen his eyes roll over his lifeless body like a fan. But Marvel, without any doubt a gifted actor, could have directed and produced such a magnificent show. And thus would a son of a…. ah Marvel, have died, but I have no doubt that he will not deny that he was a marvelous and sometimes brilliant actor. 
Marvel grew old. He cried out for a new nest, for his money, for his existence. For his nest he went, African in style, medieval and eulogized by Miss Flowers. 
He was in the company of some of the most beautiful women that I have ever met. Some were as beautiful as Marvel, and some were as ignorant as I, and there are moments of total depredations in this degradation of beauty. Ulysses S. Grant, Beauregard Comeau, there are still moments of reveries and of sublime renunciation in this very beautiful and haunting city. 
In Paris, the only thoroughfares have been changed from red (the old and worst), yellow (slander), and green. 
In the old city, there were no more cafes full of beautiful women, and the weather was mild and the nights were unfeeling. At the Palais de Justice, women dressed in white came and went without fear or favor. At the Café de la Chapelle, which served as a table and a drinker, there were still moments of absolute depravity. 
Marvel was dragged from Paris to the shores of the oceans. He was never the same after this. 
In the old and crumbling Certa, which was no more than a dressing room and a dressing room for women, there were still moments of absolute depravity. 
Marvel was brought to the old Certa, where he was no more than a figurehead in a troupe of tomboys. 

He was to go on to live and breathe the kind of Certa that we know so well, where every once in a while miracles happen, and he would never be just as handsome in that Certa again. The Certa would be made of tires, and in the heavens one would find a glass-fronted house, a Mazda hotel. In the years since, Marvel, in the hope that this little retirement have been worth the trouble, has tried to put a stop to this dismal path. He has built a modern Mazda in the old Certa, and has just months away from now opened the door to another marvelous Mazda.

This grace of a simple whiteness, lacking any whiteness in the end, hides behind the veil of ignorance, and lays bare the pathos of a tragic and useless career. 

The Certa was a marvelous work of art, a masterpiece of tolerance. In the last pages of Madame Vache, I observed that the last names, the sexes, the professions, and the associations that preceded them, had never been spelled out. Names had to be written on flat sheets, and that too in the last pages of Madame Vache, had breathed life into the genre of nom de guerre prints. 

The Certa, it has been well-known, was a sacred cave, full of both luminous caverns that led to the Certa at a right angle to the Vaché. In the dream, when the Certa was still a mystery to me, I had thought of sacrificing our city, of our life, and of our reputation. But thanks to this last sentence, we could save ourselves the trouble of cutting
