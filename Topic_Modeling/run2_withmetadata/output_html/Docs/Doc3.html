Always for the first time
Hardly do I know you by sight
You return at some hour of the night to a house at an angle to my window
A wholly imaginary house
It is there that from one second to the next
In the inviolate darkness
I anticipate once more the fascinating rift occurring
The one and only rift
In the facade and in my heart
The closer I come to you
In reality
The more the key sings at the door of the unknown room
Where you appear alone before me
At first you coalesce entirely with the brightness
The elusive angle of a curtain
It's a field of jasmine I gazed upon at dawn on a road in the vicinity of Grasse
With the diagonal slant of its girls picking
Behind them the dark falling wing of the plants stripped bare
Before them a T-square of dazzling light
The curtain invisibly raised
In a frenzy all the flowers swarm back in
It is you at grips with that too long hour never dim enough until sleep
You as though you could be
The same except that I shall perhaps never meet you
You pretend not to know I am watching you
Marvelously I am no longer sure you know
You idleness brings tears to my eyes
A swarm of interpretations surrounds each of your gestures
It's a honeydew hunt
There are rocking chairs on a deck there are branches that may well scratch you in the forest
There are in a shop window in the rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette
Two lovely crossed legs caught in long stockings
Flaring out in the center of a great white clover
There is a silken ladder rolled out over the ivy
There is
By my leaning over the precipice
Of your presence and your absence in hopeless fusion
My finding the secret
Of loving you
Always for the first time



FREE UNION

My wife whose hair is a brush fire
Whose thoughts are summer lightning
Whose waist is an hourglass
Whose waist is the waist of an otter caught in the teeth of a tiger
Whose mouth is a bright cockade with the fragrance of a star of the first magnitude
Whose teeth leave prints like the tracks of white mice over snow
Whose tongue is made out of amber and polished glass
Whose tongue is a stabbed wafer
The tongue of a doll with eyes that open and shut
Whose tongue is incredible stone
My wife whose eyelashes are strokes in the handwriting of a child
Whose eyebrows are nests of swallows
My wife whose temples are the slate of greenhouse roofs
With steam on the windows
My wife whose shoulders are champagne
Are fountains the curl from the heads of dolphins under the ice
My wife whose wrists are matches
Whose fingers are raffles holding the ace of hearts
Whose fingers are fresh cut hay
My wife with the armpits of martens and beech fruit
And Midsummer Night
That are hedges of privet and nesting places for sea snails
Whose arms are of sea foam and a landlocked sea
And a fusion of wheat and a mill
Whose legs are spindles
In the delicate movements of watches and despair
My wife whose calves are sweet with the sap of elders
Whose feet are carved initials
Keyrings and the feet of steeplejacks who drink
My wife whose neck is fine milled barley
Whose throat contains the Valley of Gold
And encounters in the bed of the maelstrom
My wife whose breasts are of the night
And are undersea molehills
And crucibles of rubies
My wife whose breats are haunted by the ghosts of dew-moistened roses
Whose belly is a fan unfolded in the sunlight
Is a giant talon 
My wife with the back of a bird in vertical flight 
With a back of quicksilver 
And bright lights 
My wife whose nape is of smooth worn stone and wet chalk 
And of a glass slipped through the fingers of someone who has just drunk 
My wife with the thighs of a skiff 
That are lustrous and feathered like arrows 
Stemmed with the light tailbones of a white peacock 
And imperceptible balance 
My wife whose rump is sandstone and flax 
Whose rump is the back of a swan and the spring 
My wife with the sex of an iris 
A mine and a platypus 
With the sex of an alga and old-fashioned candies 
My wife with the sex of a mirror 
My wife with eyes full of tears 
With eyes that are purple armor and a magnetized needle 
With eyes of savannahs 
With eyes full of water to drink in prisons 
My wife with eyes that are forests forever under the ax 
My wife with eyes that are the equal of water and air and earth and fire 



IT WAS GOING ON FIVE IN THE MORNING

It was going on five in the morning
The ship of steam stretched its chain to shatter the windows
And outside
A glowworm
Lifted Paris like a leaf
It was only a long trembling scream
A scream from the Maternity Hospital nearby
FINS FOUNDRY FANATIC
But whatever joy escaped in the exhalation of that pain
It seems to me that I was falling for a long time
I still had my fist clenched around a handful of glass
And suddenly that rustle of flowers and needles of ice
Those green eyebrows that shooting star pendulum
From what depths was the bell actually able to rise again
The hermetic bell
Which nothing last night made me foresee would stop on this 
landing
The bell whose sides read
Undine
Moving to raise your spearheaded Sagittarius pedal
You had carved the infallible signs
Of my enchantment
With a dagger whose coral handle forks into infinity
So that your blood and mine
Would become one



NO GROUNDS FOR PROSECUTION

Art of days art of nights
The scale of wounds called Parson
Red scale that quivers under the weight of a wing
When the snow-collared horsewomen with empty hands
Push their vaporous chariots across the meadows
I see this scale jummping madly up and down
I see the graceful ibis
Returning from the pool laced within my heart
The wheels of the charming dreams and its spendid ruts
Mountaing high upon the shells of their dresses
And surprise bounding wildly over the sea
Depart my darling dawn forget nothing of my life
Take these roses creeping in the mirror-well
Take every beating of every lid
Take everything down to the threads that hold the steps of rope and waterdrop dancers
Art of days art of nights
I stand before a distant window in a city filled with horror
Outside men with stovepipe hats follow one another at regular intervals
Like the rains I loved
When the weather was fine
"The Wrath of God" was the name of the cabaret I entered last night
It was written on the white facade in even whiter letters
But the lady sailors gliding behind the windows
Are too happy to be afraid
Never a body here always the murder without proof
Never the sky always the silence
Never freedom but for freedom



ON THE ROAD TO SAN ROMANO

Poetry is made in bed like love
Its unmade sheets are the dawn of things
Poetry is made in a forest

She has the space which she needs
Not this one but the other

	Governed by the hawk's eye
	The dew on the spindle
	The memory of a moist bottle of Traminer on a silver platter
	A tall rod of tourmaline over the sea
	A road of mental adventure
	Which climbs abruptly
	One pause and it's instantly overgrown

Don't shout that from the roof tops
It's not fitting to leave the doors open
Or go around calling for witnesses

	The shoals of fishes the hedges of small birds
	The rails at the approach to the great station
	The glow of two river banks
	The furrows on a loaf of bread
	Bubbles in a brook
	The days of the calendar
	Hog-wart

The act of love and the act of poetry
Are incompatible
With reading newspapers at the top of one's voice

	The way the sunlight fades
	The livid glitter which binds the ax-strokes of the woodcutter
	The string of a kite in the shape of a heart or a fish-trap
	The steady waving of the beaver's trail
	The perseverace of lightning
	The flinging down of sweets from the top of an old staircase
	An avalanche

The room of marvels
No gentlemen not the forbidden chamber
Nort the fumes of the barracks room on Sunday evenings

	The figure of the dance executed transparently above the marshes
	The body of a woman outlined by throwing knives
	The lucent rings of smoke
	The curls of your hair
	The twisting of a sponge from the Philippines
	The snakelike coils of coral
	The ivy's slitherings into the ruins
	She has all of the time ahead of her

	The embrace of poetry like the embrace of the naked body
	Protects while it lasts
	Against all access by the misery of the world



POSTMAN CHEVAL

We are the birds always charmed by you from the top of these belvederes
And that each night form a blossoming branch between your shoulders and the arms of your well beloved wheelbarrow
Which we tear out swifter than sparks at your waist
We are the sighs of the glass statue that raises itself on its elbows when man sleeps
This freedom
For which fire itself was made man
For which the Marquise de Sade defied the centuries with his great abstract trees
With his tragic acrobats
Caught in the gossamer of desire



THE SPECTRAL ATTITUDES

I attach no importance to life
I pin not the least of life's butterflies to importance
I do not matter to life
But the branches of salt the white branches
All the shadow bubbles
And the sea-anemones
Come down and breathe within my thoughts
They come from tears that are not mine
From steps I do not take that are steps twice
And of which the sand remembers the flood-tide
The bars are in the cage
And the birds come down from far above to sing before these bars
A subterranean passage unites all perfumes
A woman pledged herself there one day
This woman became so bright that I could no longer see her
With these eyes which have seen my own self burning
I was then already as old as I am now
And I watched over myself and my thoughts like a night watchman in an immense factory 
Keeping watch alone
The circus always enchants the same tramlines 
The plaster figures have lost nothing of their expression
They who bit the smile's fig
I know of a drapery in a forgotten town
If it pleased me to appear to you wrapped in this drapery
You would think that your end was approaching
Like mine
At last the fountains would understand that you must not say Fountain
The wolves are clothed in mirrors of snow 
I have a boat detached from all climates 
I am dragged along by an ice-pack with teeth of flame 
I cut and cleave the wood of this tree that will always be green 
A musician is caught up in the strings of his instrument 
The skull and crossbones of the time of any childhood story 
Goes on board a ship that is as yet its own ghost only 
Perhaps there is a hilt to this sword 
But already there is a duel in this hilt 
During the duel the combatants are unarmed 
Death is the least offence 
The future never comes

The curtains that have never been raised
Float to the windows of houses that are to be built
The beds made of lilies
Slide beneath the lamps of dew
There will come an evening
The nuggets of light become still underneath the blue moss
The hands that tie and untie the knots of love and of air
Keep all their transparency for those who have eyes to see
They see the palms of hands
The crowns in eyes
But the brazier of crown and palms
Can scarcely be lit in the deepest part of the forest
There where the stags bend their heads to examine the years
Nothing more than a feeble beating is heard
From which sound a thousand louder or softer sounds proceed
And the beating goes on and onThere are dresses that vibrate
And their vibration is in unison with the beating
When I wish to see the faces of those that wear them
A great fog rises from the ground
At the bottom of the steeples behind the most elegant reservoirs of life and of wealth
In the gorges which hide themselves between two mountains 
On the sea at the hour when the sun cools down 
Those who make signs to me are separated by stars 
And yet the carriage overturned at full speed 
Carries as far as my last hesitation 
That awaits me down there in the town where the statues of bronze
and of stone have changed places with statues of wax Banyans banyans.
