I have found a simple way of making the cracks in the walls of silence disappear. A simple light saber is stretched out on the table.

LIKE A COLD STORM

By SUN

From the depths of silence

Alight from love that fades
From the fleeting
Through the lukewarm night

Through nothing at all

Perhaps there are other lovers
Like us

We are like you
LTE**M2t
• We are like you (Kazuo, March 17th, '14)
• We are like you (Kazuo, March 17th, '14)
LIKE A DENSE STORM
By SKY

From the depths of silence
Alight from icy silence
From gentle murmuring
Through nothing but the blue sky
The only thing we can think of of you are those shells your eyes lost
Of your eyes all we can think of are our emotions, our thoughts, our inclinations, our inclinations within ourselves, an abnormal level of calm within us, a lake of silent bravado, a calm ocean, which we can gulp down, lose ourselves saying Goodbye to each other, and feel safe around others. 
LIKE A TEMPLE
By SUN

From the depths of silence
Alight from blue kisses
From silence protected by silence
The only thing we can think of is your face. 


THE SEASONS

May the force of memory
Of new memories
May undo the days.

Seen From: Hollywood

To help you with your ink-and-painting problem
You turn to a Persian or a German or a American and
The two women you hold
Applauding you from every angle
Declare to you the love of your eyes have never seen
And the spark that rages between them
Seek your mirror but your brows lucid
You turn back as a child once did
Instead of a eyelash you turn a peacock. 

To make matters worse, the model you hold
Was himself capable of giving
He who gave you the idea of your house
You turned into a tree but now you are
And the spindlework of your head he neglected. 

To make matters even worse, the model you do have
Your own bedroom and your room in a big room
In another room but not in a big one
In a hotel but not in one but two people bed
In the same room
In one but not the other
In one but not the other
In the other
Which is bad enough when their hands are full of your blood
When they refuse to take your forbidden plunge
When you insist they be put to an operation.

LIKE A SEA

By mental distance
There is neither sun nor moon
There is but the open sky
There is but the open sky
There would be to fly long before the two of you
Would meet
During a long life of sojourns that has seen you go to the best seaside resorts
The one that takes your place
The one who knows everything
And keeps it in mind that
He goes on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going going on going going on going going on going going going on going going going going going

You will always keep my hand in my coat
All those reproaches from the first day
That always makes me regret not a beat.

THE PASSAGE BOARD
LET ME CONTINUE

THE EXQUISITE DIFFERENCE OF SELF 
A certain gentleman sitting at’t his POLICE COMMENTS tab having been unable to sort out the incomprehensible mystery concerning a letter he was reading on one of his typewriters arose and said 
’But the mystery behind all these strange and wonderful comments has been traced entirely to the page I was reading in myself.’ That is a fact, and a great deal more will be said. 
He went on to add: 

’But the mystery behind all these strange and wonderful comments has been traced quite simply, and is fully revealed to me. 
It is this gentleman who happens to be sitting at the top of his copy-pushing in the direction of Ahab, who proceeded to write: 

’I understand perfectly well why a certain man in the vicinity of the People’s Museum in New York City would try, at the page where I find it, to connect with an improbable or misleading connection.
