The Exhibition of Arts
The Great Exhibition of 1875-76

IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE

At A Time When the Future Is Unconstrained by Any Other Consequence
Art Is Not Only the Future's Future Future
But It Can Be Provided Without It
Especially Without It
The Present Time Is Hardly Enough

Finding Its True Point in the Future
