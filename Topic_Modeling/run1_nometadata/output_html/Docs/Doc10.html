There goes my mother, Sir, with my fiancée.
There they go, arm in arm,
The young woman slapped me; the old woman spanked me.

I swear to you I loved them both;
But I always had the benign need to ask for
Too much love: her tears, and her breast.

I swear to you they loved me well.
Surely it's not their fault
That I always wanted more.

Yes, Sir, that's my mother with my fiancée.

For me they are one and the same person, their charms
Are equal, having made me shed the same tears.
My mother wept over me, while I was sobbing

Over the other one, refusing to be altogether mine;
I don't know which of the three of us was most hurt .. .
There goes my mother, Sir, with my fiancée.





A SINGLE BEING

I

Has made the pure snow melt,
Caused flowers to be born among the grasses
And released the sun.

Oh! daughter of varied seasons,
Your feet attach me to the earth
And I love it all year long.

Our love laughs with this springtime
As it does for all your beauty,
For all your goodness.

II

Flute and violin,
The rhythm of a clear song
Raises our two like hearts
And the seagulls from the sea.

Forget our separate gestures,
The laughter of sounds scatters,
Our dream is realized.

We shall possess the horizon,
The good earth that carries us,
And the fresh deep space,
Flute and violin.

III

What more can I tell you, my love?
In the morming, in the garden,
The skylark Swallows the freshness.
Day occupies us
Touches our hearts.

Day pervades us
And all morning, looking for the sun,
The bird becomes quiet on delicate branches.
Fleeing work, we go towards the sunlight
Eyes content and light of limb.

You know the retum, my love,
The bird sings with us,
The sky is adorned with its flight,
The sky having darkened
All the green darkened.

IV

The whole sea shines
The whole sea abandons
The earth and its obscure burden.

Dream of a world disappeared
Whose virtue you conserve
Or the dream

That you kept me on these waves
That the light ... And under the sun,
The wind leaves the immense land.



TO LIVE HERE

Your laughter is like a whirlwind of autumn leaves
Chafing against the warm air, enveloping it, when rain comes.
Bitter, you annul every tragedy,
Your laughter gets the better of your concern to become a man.

I should like to shut you in with your old suffering
Cast off, which let you off so easy,
Between the many walls, the many skies
Of my sorrow and our reason.

There you would find again so many others
So many other lives and hopes
You would be forced to see
To remember that you knew how to lie...

Your laughter is like a whirlwind of autumn leaves.

* * * *

The wind passes through dead branches
Like my thoughts in books,
There I am, voiceless, empty handed,
And my room is filled by my open window.

Strolling, taking it easy, looking around
For shadow or light,
My life goes along with the lives of others.

Evening comes, voiceless, nothing there.
I stay, looking for some desire, some pleasure;
In vain, I can only be astonished at having felt
My pain like a little sunlight in the cold water.



PREFACE

May an honest strength return to us.

A few poets, builders, ever youthful, had already shown us the way.

Let's be aware of what we are capable of doing.

Beauty or ugliness do not seem necessary to us. Rather, we have always been otherwise concerned with power or grace, gentleness or brutality, with simplicity or multiplicity.

Vanity, which leads one to declare something beautiful or ugly, and to take sides, is responsible for the refined error of several literary ages, for their sentimental exaltation and the disorder which ensued.

Let us try to remain absolutely pure, however difficult that may be. Then we shall become aware of all which brings us together.

As for the displeasing language which satisfies gossips, that language as dead as the crowns on our like brows; let's reduce and transform it into a truthful language of charm, of common exchange among us.

For my part, nothing seems to be a better sign of this intention than the poem written as I have been imagining this opening page:



SALON

Love of permitted fantasies
Of sunshine,
Of lemons,
Of airy mimosa.
Clarity of the means used:
A clear window pane,
Patience,
And the vessel to be pierced.

Sunshine, lemons, light mimosa
In the stronghold of the fragility
Of glass containing
This gold in balls,
This rolling gold.



AN ANIMAL LAUGHS

The world laughs,
The world is happy, content, joyful.
The mouth opens, opens its wings, falls again.
Young mouths fall again
Old mouths fall again.

An animal laughs too,
Stretching the joy of its contortions
Everywhere in the land
Fur is ruffled, fleece dances
And birds lose their feathers.

An animal laughs too,
Jumps away from himself.
The world is laughing,
An animal is laughing too,
An animal runs away.



HORSE

Horse alone, lost,
Sick from the rain, vibrating with insects,
Lonely old horse.
. . . .
Faithful to the pebbles
Lonely horse awaits the night
To avoid having to see danger
And run away.



HEN

Alas! my sister, silly beast,
It's not for your clucking song
Over the egg
That men hold you in esteem.




FISH

Fish, swimmers and boats
Transform the water.
Water is soft, yielding
Only to what touches it.

The fish advances
Like a finger in a glove,
The swimmer slowly dances,
The sail breathes.

Yet gentle water yields
To whatever touches it,
For the fish, the swimmer, the boat
That it bears
And carries away.



BIRD

Charmed .. . Oh! poor girl!
The birds disturb
The blinding sunshine on the roof,
Birds play at replacing
The sunshine lighter than the oil
That flows between us.



DOG

Warm pup,
Living by the voice and gestures
Of your master,
Take life like the wind,
With your nose.
And be still.



CAT

Putting only a finger on it we know
The cat is much too big.
Its tail joins its head,
It turns in a circle
And responds to a caress.

But at night we see its eyes
A pale glow their only attribute.
They are too big to be concealed
Too heavy for the lost wind of a dream.

The cat dances
To isolate its prison
It thinks as far
As the limits of its eyes.



MODEL

The trees' netting took in many birds
Naturally
The birds' feet connected the certain branches
To their bones.



UTILITARIAN MAN

You can't work any more. Dream,
Open-eyed, openhanded
In the wilderness
In the wilderness that plays
With the animals — the useless ones.

Following order and disorder,
On the level plains, in deep forests,
In the weighty, clear ocean,
An animal passes by — and your dream
Is surely one of repose.



FEATHERS

Man would like to have emerged
From a mess of wings.
Way up there, the wind flows howling
Along the length of a wing.

But the mother wasn't there
When the nest flew away,
And the sky was beating its wings
When the nest blew away.

And to the earth's dismay,
Man lies among his words,
Along dead branches,
In empty shells.



DAMPENED

The stone rebounds on the water
Smoke does not penetrate there.
Water, like a skin
None can wound,
Is caressed
By man and by fish.

Snapping like a bowstring,
The fish, when caught by the man,
Expires, unable to swallow
This planet of air and light.

But man sinks to the waters' depths
For the fish, .
Or for the bitter solitude
Of the supple, unyielding waters.



PAW

The cat settles down in the night to yowl,
In the free air of night, the cat meows.
And sorrowful, standing at a man's height,
Man hears its cry.



HEN [2]

The hen must lay:
The hen with its ripe fruits
Hen for our profit




TO FLEE

The speedy spider,
With feet and hands of fear,
Has arrived,

The spider,
Happy with her weight,
Is motionless
Like the sinker at the end of the line.

And when she takes off again,
Breaking all the threads,
It's a chase in space
We must imagine,

Everything destroyed.



Examples

FOUR CHILDREN

The gourmand down to the bone,
Blowing up his cheeks,
Swallowing a flower,
Sweet smelling inner skin.

Nice child,
A whistle,
A rosy mouth, of course,
Light mouth under the heavy brow.
One to ten, ten to one.

The orphan, the breast that nurses him wrapped in black
Will not wash him,
Dirty
As a forest on a winter's night.

A dead one,
White teeth, but his beautiful eyes still,
fixed!
What fly in his life
Is the mother of the flies of his death?



OTHER CHILDREN

Confidence;
"Little child of my five senses
and of my tenderness,”
Let us cradle our loves,
We will have good children.
Well cared for,
We will fear nothing on earth,
Happiness, good fortune, prudence,
Our loves

And this leap from age to age,
From the order of a child to that of an old man,
Will not diminish us.
(Confidence).
