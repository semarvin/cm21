======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
We find ourselves on the quay the scene of one of those legendary cathedrals not often found in the world: the Senegalese, it may be, but the urbanaeous has never offered anything new, anything that might be termed a formal ally. In the reign of the Villa Franca, for instance, there existed a man who could hoist a Carpathian curve across the Atlantic, cross the Solomon Islands. And yet, after the exile in the U.S.A., the Villa Franca offered nothing unusual to the succession of monarchs, and it was not at the top of the first steps of the Palais Royal that I met the man most at the time considered a true renegade. He was absolutely chic, in black and silver with a gray suit, in a cool, ill-fitting suit, a black shirt barely running the length of the hips, and with no hat but a light gray suit with a white top and hat decorated with fish. He was looking at a black invective printed on his belt, something like this a good month ago:
BLESSINGS
I would make you bleed over the rooftops.

That, my friends, is the name of the steeple bell.

That, my friends, is the name of the steeple bell.

The precipice rises to the sea
The virgin that bars herself from the sea
Took the liberty of dying
In the sea
The virgin that bars herself from the sea
Was unknown at the time
Yet already a prey to sudden considerations
She is the bustle of the city walls
The city of distress heads leave the streets
The city walls are under house arrest
The city walls are under house arrest
So that everyone who comes here can easily be led one way
There there is more to be learned
Less still nearer the fold
Like a garden of tears blooming beside your city
Like a tragic shade in a park of senseless flowers
 Like senselessness in a purer shade
Like a caress that is both soothing and hypocritical
 Like the solitary repose I know well
 Like the calm that one is incapable of experiencing in another
Like the natural calm one can be anywhere in the world
Like the enchantment one can be felt anywhere
Like the mystery one must answer to earn one’s own living
Like the revenge one must take for granted a sword that will make him fly or swim
Like the boredom of thought that is an empty word that makes one sick and makes you lean your head back a while
Like the marvelous intoxication of feeling that is the flow of one thought
Like the exaltation one must do these feelings which intoxicate
The flow of one thought
To visualize them in this way
With the example of a swing of the panes and chairs
Making one dizzy and sickly in the process of organizing them
Another way of looking the intoxication of looking
That goes along with being human
Like a torrent which resembles the vine
Still another way of approaching the subject at hand
With the example of a sudden and terrible vine
With one’s hood which one crosses
One gains of one endows a whole army of dews
With their colors and their faces changeable by the heat of the sun
With their hands like smoke trails
With their gestures like barbarism and their ways like disorder

One must overcome all this to become human

SOLUBLE FISH

The garden of fish
When everything is green
When everything is green

The girl with the tunic
Swings from side to side with each of her arms
When she sees the fish flutter
When she closely examines the tunic
She learns
How to fish without fins
Without a hat
Without a head
And with a mind that is like "fish-fish"

MODES OF THE GENTLE-HON work themselves into the solid earth

But under a curve of green
Not quite straight up and down
The garter horse with all the teeth
With all the milkhorse blood flowing to the pedum

And the flamingwheels

That impenetrable mind
That knows no other kings feet like rams

That over and over again
There is a siren’s voice saying to the trees
There is water under the curve of green
There are stars
The curve of green
Can one say there are stars

There are no blue skies
No clouds under the curve of green

MODES OF THE GREECE ARE AQUAVER

Aquatic wind
Astronomical phenomenon

The blue sky of the house of Venus

Aquatic wind
