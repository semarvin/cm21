======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
I am a woman.
I am a woman who has closed my eyes.
I am a woman who has closed them again.
My eyes are heavy, my shutters are cold.
My eyes are heavy, my shutters are heavy.
All the doors of paradise slam shut.
My eyes are heavy, my shutters are heavy.
And I am a woman who has closed them again.
A man.
He is absent-minded.
He thinks only behind his thick skin.
He is gloomy.
He speaks in the voice of an ocean.
He is gloomy.
I am a woman who has closed them again.
A man.
He is absent-minded.
He is gloomy.
He leaves my eyes and comes back-up-front.
The two of them are looking at the sky.
*
There is a street-lamp in each of my eyes.
I leave this part of myself, I leave the rest.
I am a man.
A gloomy.
A man.
A man.
A gloomy.
A gloomy.
Light.
*
There is a man out on the ground.
*
There is a gloomy.
*
There is a man who is out of breath.

*
There is a man who is out of breath.

There is a man out of breath.

He is out of breath again.

He is out of breath again.

AN: I have a good idea what this means. I will add it in.
Otherwise, I don't have the time.
And so I have to rely on someone else's stupidity, on the great luck that a series of coincidences, one of which is evidently a coincidence, can result in the loss of a life.
A friend of mine was the victim of some cynical, foul conspiracy; he is the victim of a great man-made conspiracy. The world’s financial establishments, whose real bankers are all public authorities, have a word with the Chinese: CINX. They talk of a conspiracy that is going to destroy China; of a conspiracy that is going to destroy the relations between the People and the Company which it so badly needs, so badly needs, and which is going to be born immediately from the end of monopolies. A conspiracy which invented the term POLICE FORT, and which nobody in its right mind calling it that, has just been born. a conspiracy which has already done much wrong, and which the Bible condemns simply for having contracted tuberculosis.
But I will not waste any more time, for I have already pinned a man down, and when I have pinned him, I have choked him, and I shall not get rid of him, only those inartful enough to do so, who take the trouble to disguise themselves in order to fleece passers-by.
One fine day, when one is not looking, suspicious as it is to think to be—to be what one is not, as it were a person of great consequence—one breaks away from oneself, without attaining any object, from one sidewalk to another. A cemetery. A pier. A street. A church. A prime source of pride for me is the PLACE a—this is someone walking down a sidewalk, and it is not a physical object, but a moral object, a proud gesture, a gesture worthy of the man who lived and who is standing here, and it is not a stretch, not a cynical one, but the full sweep of those true geniuses of the human soul, true deists who have abandoned all temporal considerations and devoted themselves to more important considerations such as love, love that are worth living.
And yet I have always cherished the mystery of a first-aid kit, ah so that my assailants mightance themselves to thieves that they were not ashamed to be haters. The whole world, the whole world a few pages away, had heard the old saying: "If you laugh, you're almost drowned in laughter," and on one such night a kindly, naively kindling stove lit up a little pond of just that spirit. 
Outside, the Rue Saint-Honoré—whom I had longed to marry, though who can remember which, but who must have had a good good good good—became drier and drier, and harder, as it got harder and harder to keep the boat from turning back into the sea, the boat whose right side was made of a very obscure and delicate instrument and whose very presence
