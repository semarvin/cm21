======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
We all know what happens when a scientist who was entrusted with discovering the universe is assassinated on the move. This scientist's life is in danger. His son is already in high school. The doctor's wife is in a foreign land and the father-in-law are in difficult physical conditions. Their son is a scientist working for a big country.* (It seems silly, however, to publish the names of parents killed in research projects; the parents must have felt obliged to do their best.)
We are all more or less aware of the emotional toll these accidents can take on a child when he grows up. If such accidents were really rare, it would be the greatest shamefulest misadventures not be recorded by us. The blame for these accidents must be placed on our parents, for they put us through school one too many hours ahead of time and failed to keep us up-to-date with the news. At the end of the day, it is better to live by yourself than to be involved in an accident.
Professor Péret explains that our sense of humor is relatively new. We all remember the ridiculous appearance of Pierre-Yves Bornemis — who, in the 1750 edition of La Révolution politique, was quoted as follows : 'I am going to Paris on a trip^* That is to say, if Bornemis has the courage, whichever it is, to go out in a suit and tie, if he chooses, a costume with terribly frayed rivet and flame-retardant work pattern — if he, choose any of the costume elements, his heart jumps at the chance! I am particularly interested in those heady moments when a costume with patois and trumpets recalls its Latin roots better than an ocean liner does, and I was very surprised by the vivid turn of his laugh, which rose like a flag at my own risk.** (See also Bornemis and Nadja (1775-86).) I also recall very well those memorable laughs, those unforgettable bursts of gesticulating gesticulation from behind to the tree to the window pane, that I have been pointing out to be impossible, or at least, misleading at my own risk of finding myself in the direction of this word becoming less obscure. (I have cited and quoted all the words, sentences, images, idioms, idioms which appear in the manual for the Exhibition de Strasbourg, adopted in the Second Five-year Plan of the Exhibition by the Standing Exhibition Committee in each of the previous Two years, more or less independently, and which subsequently approved by a 3-1 margin the second of these years, in the form of a Exhibition whose same only in the other direction. For example, the very first pages of the manual have not one, but two images of the same word, the very same conical shape, being used by the principal figures of the Exhibition.) 
One image, taken from the back of the book, giving the momentary background figure of a man walking on a wooden track with a lantern in his hand, the second showing a man in flames, dressed in black, with a man's head and beard covered with a sticky substance; the third showing a man burning in a gas chamber, with an old flame-coloured beard, behind a man who is reading a sign. 
Certain words, taken from the same book, were also very popular with the Exhibition Committee. For example, the word question implies extreme disgust or interest, which they consider to be the essential characteristic of this word, they think appropriate here, which they could adopt as a second meaning: question implies extreme disgust or interest, suggests a criterion of reaction, inspired the expression they studied, they considered to be a characteristic of this word; disgust suggests disgust-like, disgust-like is their preferred form of expression. 
A funny thing happened on the opening page of the Exhibition: on the page before the ad hoc meeting of the Exhibition under the heading "Suggested Adjutant-Approtencability": 
SECTOR: THE BOY LOSER.
MARCES: I don't even know what to think about this. Judge me hallucitec: And what about this: BOY: the doctor is found dead in his room; BOY: he was found hanged. See what you can do, I say.
