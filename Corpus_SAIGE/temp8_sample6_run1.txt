======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
I am a pretty blonde, so the idea of being blonde is hard to swallow. I've had pretty blonde cheeks before, and a pink one a few years ago when I was in high school. I also had a pink eye turn on me a pretty eye just the same. But now, I've had lips so pink I can't even put one understatement. And a mouth so pink, so red, I can see it now, almost nightmarish-blue, in a man whom I'm sure I'll never meet. And a mouth so red, so damned pale, that I can't see who made it here, who wants to make it there, who will make it here.
At first, I suspected something was up. Then I thought I'd found the kissor: it was in fact a box with a dimly lit door at the end that opened onto a large room in which to bookings could be made in advance, incoming evening sessions for couples, and a bedroom, which was an infinity pool where even the most boring back and forths by birdsong could be heard daily. A sofa with a comfortableing made it perfect for me to sit, and by the volume of the room too, I was given the idea that a dog might be quiet. I also got a pretty red joint for my thighs, just the way they are, with the thighs that I enjoy eating hot, and the thighs of sedentary human beings who don't have any other food for the dogs than the potatoes of sleeping in the corner of the screen where there isn't any light. Smell, smell! I shall have them for a good brownie-cake.
Another notion which intrigued me, while on a mission about the bend of the Australian, usedfully as a landing formation in the Bible Belt, provided I took along a young officer who had been promoted to sergeant and a regiment as large as my own when I picked him out, with its penchant for inflicting wounds, with its nose rotten with history, to train as lie detectors (as the beautiful Captain Boon put it), with its brilliant eyes gleaming with a blue eye and its mouth ajar (as if it feared the day the grille would light up in the inner city and would have to be shuttered), with its sleek black moustache, and its spewing forthofbird just desserts at the opportunity cost of even one more word in the dictionary! I was proud of myself, I was brave, brave to stand up to injustice, to defy this wave of evil, brave to stand up to that wave!
But all this boasting does not prevent me from weighing up the pros and cons of each in turn. It's not the same in life—not since the days of L’arch, when it was still pretty much "Catholic" to get down to the nub of an inebriation. It also doesn’t even come as a surprise to me when I think about all the baggage that must be taken to climb to reach such a destination, to be there in the first place, to have the good grace to meet the Catholic women who come along, even though their first name—Hey!—is Never-Me. None of them even bother to "upgrade," "revisit," "recast." How does one day, twenty years from now, be able to date when you feel comfortable flunkishing without even even even really looking at it from a human point of view? It’s called arrogance. And how does one possibly be able to date someone who’s not even a little arrogant, when someone is thin, when people talk themselves to be ridiculously handsome? It’s easy to see into the fog of arrogantness, to be quiet into the arrogance of unimaginative hypocrites. And how does one possibly be able to date someone who doesn’t even listen to them at all? I can’t help it, therefore, if I say that there are people alive who would be happy to give me telephone numbers, to whatever extent they please, to listen in the light, to see if we can guess at your existence, if there are still a great number of telephone numbers who could be of assistance, to see if there are still one by one, to see if there are still one or two, if there even are—if not, at least try to guess—what you do at reading people’s eyes. It’s as simple and as simple as that. Ah, the blotter: 

War and Peace 
Onew nich that same year, as Sketches 
And Curses On Chirpierieland's Verdure. 
And later on Chirpierieland’s Chirurgers as they arrive in Paris. 
And what a delight it is to meet you, to make use of your gestures in the preferences at our discretion, to feel invited, we think, not to be
