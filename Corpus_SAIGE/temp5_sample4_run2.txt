The sun is always on my left. I leave this area, which is only a few hundred meters from the main road. I go toward the house of the taxi-seller. He is on my right. I say:
"The house on your left is yours. I'll go meet Nadja."
Nadja is waiting for me at the corner of the Rue Lafayette and the Rue de Crimée. She seems quite at home in the shadow of the walls, set on a bench on the right, like everyone else on this side of the road. A keyless- vout is left on the ground. A letter says I must leave. But Nadja says she doesn't want to see me. She scolds me for thinking I'm immortal. 
I leave.

'Where are we?'
This question has the appearance of a demand for justice. It constantly rears its eye, until I ask the same question in a third person. I have time to ask. And the same things turn up in all three of us: first, the remark that there is no such thing as antedated communication, between the writer and the writer's agent, and secondly, the remark about the color yellow. 
The same thing happens with the entire sky: there is, on the right, a solid screen, and, alternately, an image projector and a printed map. The same thing happens with the night: on the map the night is aligned vertically with the axis of the north star, and the colored night is opposed by the Earth to the North by Tyrian city, and, on the projector's side, the compass bearing of the star G (which also happens to be the axis of the axis of the axis of the globe) is reversed. 
Thus the object we are looking at is the Night, a creature whose movements we are unable to consciously control. It is a single-minded quest for knowledge which we all burst out into with joy at the discovery, at the suggestion of the make-up artists, that you want it, the government wants it.
