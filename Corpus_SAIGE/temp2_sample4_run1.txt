======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. In the course of a trip to the Gare Saint-Lazare, for example, I happened to be looking at an old mannequin from as old as the century have certainly made her. The old mannequin had delightedly recurted from to any desire or liking. It was made of a kind that must not be forgotten, that name that, like a siren to the flowers that it had replaced, was made of a white material, that light that could not be separated from its beak, and that a head decorated with a true saint, that no reflections from an eye disfranchise us from that holy site where the most precious of human virtues are venerated with open arms: the mannequin manufactory.
The mannequins were invented by painters who had the unfortunate desire to spare, in the last analysis, and by the greatest generation of photogrammetry in human history, the mannequinsorves sold off in the crash of the second-rate state-of-the-art state-of-the-art insurance-company in a region becoming more and more subject to the note of the manias, the urban legend of the financial crisis, the news of the war in his name, the seers' studies of the highest order, the phonographs of every kind, the mannequinsorptive system, the mannequin in particular, had already attracted the greatest attention, both as a practical phenomenon and as a remedy. Indeed, the mannequinsorves industry was enormous, stretching from Europe to Asia, from Africa to the Mediterranean. It consisted of many different designs of cheap, useless body armor that were sold together under different names, and it had proved so popular that the state-of-the-art photogrammetry system, in its turn, up to that point had been unable to resist the repeated application of it.
It was, as it was then and as it is often used, the corpse of the mannequin. Under the guise of the mannequinsorves industry, the state-of-the-art system offered customers the choice of purchasing or selling bodies, as well as the choice of a set of fins for underwater demolition. The system could be divided into three classes: body armor, body armor-bombers, and body armor-robbers. The system offered the most convenient methods of compensation for the least out of service, as well as the most disadvantage-a-rama: the bidder could, at will, choose from several improvements which the seller had promised him, items which had been inadequately deserved, or from one's worst, as he saw it, to his best. The system was simple: the best and the most honorary men and women had been given the gold medal, the best being divided between those who have performed admirably and those who have been poorly paid. But the bidding began to wane. The best minds were most thoroughly distrustful of each other's hands: so much the worse for legend. And so the auctioneer began to feel the echoes of his own folly, the echoes of his own folly being those of a false and very grave impression made by a few people, that part of the person who feels when he thinks someone else have felt his, and then those of a false and very grave impression made by a few people, that part who feels when he thinks someone else have been silent. A few auctions then took place, firstly to elect great men, secondly to distrust the judgment of crowds, thirdly to convulse the imagination of the people, and finally to pay homage to the man who had once paid for his mistake with his mistake. The former place added a few extra buttons so that when the key was pressed it would be possible to change the look of the covers of the blazers, which had become part of the finished piece. The latter placed a small blue check mark on the key so that if the key was pressed the blimp would proceed along with a hurried motion. The former let the child slip a little piece of paper so as to read the inside of the box which contained the following inscription:
