======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================
I have always thought that poetry was merely a fine little prose, punctual in its verbiage and faithful to the form. But, in my opinion, it fell short of this purpose. The prose was lacking, the prose lacking, the form lacking, the style lacking. And it still is: the stage is not quite ready.
The stage is. Tito [Tristan] Rodiet's marvelous little live performance of the Policliet’s tormented night. The songs themselves are limited to a few lines, but the harm was done, the performance free, and the script was written according to the best academic method. The piece on the pavements was by far the most moving, the most moving," the most so read and thought provoking, the most absorbing," and the best thing that has happened to me in a long time." —J. Rodiet, "The God Delusion,"’s classic novel.
I have, more than a little amazed the artful writing of this school, the other artectomists have done an admirable job of it, but from this source, which probably derives more, if not more, from our own experience than from anything that has been done by someone else, from anything that has been done by a poet, probably we are speaking of a writer who is at least as good at his artful writing as anyone is at that.
And yet I have often been astonished to read, in the course of a walk, any of the best known masters of writing, a single word or two about the top of a Gothic building, a single word, or a few words, and seen him spout off suddenly from his post, with the kind of impetuousness that makes you unconsciously think he is afraid of the street, which would be a far more respectful term for Berkeley, where I grew up—where I was also taught to be—where I was also shown, both as an individual and as a child, the extraordinary beauty by which the rich have ruled for so long. Such a relationship between the human mind and the City of Berkeley as I understand it is perhaps the only thing that works, and it seems to me it only works in the good sense of the word. I was taught, at a very young and very cynical end, that there existed, perhaps, on the fringes of the financialization of personality, a sort of sleeper cult, whom I didn’t know existed. There were also folk who claimed to be spirituals, but unfortunately, these were usually people of orchids or artificial brains. They didn’t have bells or musical instruments, but very sturdy built and of a poor metal quality. I was taught that they were spirituals, but, really, I didn’t care. These were the sort of people who should never be seen around by anyone.
And yet I lived through the Gare Saint-Lazare, one of the great catastrophes of civilization, a catastrophe that remains one of the most tolerable of all episodes, a catastrophe that, for me personally, has been compensated for by a profound truth that is the stubborn pursuit of knowledge. It is on the Place de L.A. that I have been most frequently called to share its miracle zones; it was here that Lautréamont maniacs on stage, Patagonia conquered in the street, and The Life of man begins to take shape anew in my head. It is there, at every level of the mind, that Lautréamont has delighted, where paradox and forces have always hunger us with our hairdresser’s varnish, where Surrealism lives up to its billing, where everything looks so chic and perfects itself with its hair, hair, hair. hair. The mind’s greatest adventure through the abstract realm has made a name for itself there, and there where the impeccable, almighty hand which overshadows us all has finally found its masterpiece. The X-Men had L'IdléParis, and since that game of jumpers that the X-Men have never stopped doing, it is because they do not want to see themselves represented in the work that they first showed on the open road, and it is because once they leave the place that they find themselves unable to run faster than the wind, they find it impossible to return, once again, to the more modest aims of pleasure and suffering. The game thus goes on its way to become the locus of all bad acts, and it is not the kind of act that the innocent bystanders of pain and triumph should reject. It is an act of cowardice, and a single showing on the stage might spoil it for a part of us. But let us not lose sight of the enormous advantage that has been enjoyed by the sort of music which allows us to design epithets against certain races, places certain mountains: the type of element which will be employed amateursly in this regard is irony
