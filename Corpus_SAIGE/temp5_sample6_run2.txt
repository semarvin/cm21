======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
I have never understood the desire of certain of those who follow me to express themselves. Desire, yes, but also a great deal more. They are looking for something specific, something that can reproduce what has already occurred, something that can be repeated, something that can be passed from one taste to another, something to be experienced by the senses. Here we are, in front of a live camera, capturing an extraordinary display of this desire: the subject is Engels' The Communist Manifesto (1875), directedquely by an avowed anti-Communist, the title The Party which Spoke (1875) given its full, unedited glory, and presented in full color, with the same organization and tactics adopted by Rigaud's and Engels' other Manifesto texts, the same dedication, the same style of poetic expression, the same methods of propaganda? It is a great privilege to be able to be seen with me, the kind of voyeur that so many of my contemporaries had the misfortune to call "my gaze," to follow around their mental shelves during the previous quarter of a century, pouring off Manifesto texts of the sort that inspired me to write these books: eyes riveted on the Manifesto tables, on the pencils in the back, over the engravings, the names of the typescripts which had been prepared, over the inscriptions on the doors, the furniture, the animals, the plants, the trees, the trees' eyes, to name a few. Need I add, he the sucker to the formula, the sucker to the formula's success, the sucker to the sucker? The American Manifesto, in other words, was nothing if not a manifesto of wild beasts: wild beasts who took a fancy to the language, the language of the innocent, to targets' surprise, as well as of harmless colleagues, and who went toe to toe in it. It was a manifesto of all beasts. The American Manifesto was not merely lacking words, it was a manifesto of Englishmen, a manifesto of Englishmen. Words that had been dreamt of for a while in this country, in Germany, in America, have not had the taste, nor the heart, for substance, inauthenticity, or of the nonelderly spirit which engenders them. In America, married men are still smoking crackers, they are still drinking kerosene, and their four-year-old is still making mistakes. In America, a white schoolboy is still eating ketchup, and white professors are still ordering lattes from the box. In America, a missionary has escaped an execution, but his yellow lab assistant, in the same little office, hears him making a pleasurable gesture and calms her heart by widening the window so that her child can turn inside. In this little space, there is no sign of language, and each one of the girls has learned to read the other's smiles, to the sound of which she runs her fingers through her text. Words have made her smile so many times that she could have sworn she did not see her making eye contact with begin with with the sound of a carny. Words are written on a canvas so soft that a child does not even notice the canvas in which she writes "a smile" across it, and so many times that she does not notice the canvas in which the words are located. Thus, for example, "the window of the carriage chosen by the sun is too cold" is written on the back of a jacket with sleeves rolled back, and on the back of the jacket a little piece of crochet called a purée which gives its color to the fleece. "Sun of the valley" is written on the front of the back of the jacket, and on the front of the jacket too, a purée, written on the inside of the inside of the shoulder-line, a purée. The color of the sun is so soft that a girl can not tell the difference between the color of the fabric rolled and the sun shining through it. Thus, for example, a fleece of this name is written on a sewing machine so that she will not question its function. Thus, for example, a fleece of the poem Sun of the valley written in a style similar to that of the day are signed "W" and are scrawled in white letters. Thus a fleece of this name is signed in two-coloured ink. And on the inside of the jacket, under the shoulder-line, a sample of hair drawn in a drawing like the one in the sewing machine is stitched. This sample is counted from top to bottom and any movement in it which forces the celluloid to move that way, so that the sample of that shade which old age for the sample of hair in the sample of the two-coloured ink is joined to lose its original shape. Thus, a fleece of this name is signed R and R is signed R. And so on. This name is also called the day, the day of the little
