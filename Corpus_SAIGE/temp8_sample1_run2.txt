======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
In the days of the olden days, when lady pirates were a bit more common, pirates without a ship, and pirates who made a living off the sea, pirates without a ship, and pirates who made a life for the sea, with no plans at all, on these voyages, there were a hundred pirates of every color, and there are many with a blue life. Today, there are more pirates than ever: customs officers, heads of hair, shipwreckers, pirates who've stolen a by stripping their foes of their beards and feathers, divers who've left a smile on their wake, pirates who've wrecked ships, treasure hunters, treasure hunters with their obsessions, treasure hunters who've forgotten their saddles, treasure hunters who've forgotten their hands, treasure hunters who've hung their nets on the reefs, treasure hunters who've forgotten their scales, treasure hunters who've rented the parlours, treasure hunters who swear by a god with hearts of stone, treasure hunters who swallow pills, and treasure hunters who beat their chests with pencils. Today, there are twenty of each sex. Today we see a woman, forty-eight at least, with a hundred fairer, though she is quite a heroine. Tomorrow we may see her Tatiana, with her customary green veils, her hour of beauty and her way with her veils. Crowned in her swim trunks are the tortoisesques of innocents, pirates, murderers, and muskrats. Tomorrow we may meet a Hispanow in full sail, Lesenix, Merovingian, the coal ash marshal, Mathieu, Cleary, the Surrealists, Calcutta, and India. Tomorrow we may meet the ebony Victorinielia with its veils, its Mary Suella, in full costume with its breezes, breezes from a lifetime of poverty and its natural bridal nets, its Negress waistcoat, for the poor, her lace bangs, and her natural earrings. Tomorrow we may spend the winter with a skinull, with a beautiful silk stockings, with a nape of the neck, a necklace, then a udder with a striking network of the hips, and then, finally, a lace sheen with a striking eye, her husband, and his fiancée, in full costume. Tomorrow we may go on a red-white-and-blue excursion, a boat through forests, or a horse hoisted high by a suspension-stabilizer, and the animals, the birds, the plants, and the animals themselves, become one. The car might as welldie, for all the world has rediscovered its mirrors, its hypocrites, its rigours, its scorn. Tomorrow we may meet in a hotel, with all the requisites of hairdieur, mistress of the house, and the flowers, and the serving-pot, and the mirrors... and the mirrors themselves, in hotel splendour, still remain mirrors through and through.
Towards the end of the third act, we may imagine that this Héléne Secord which I have already witnessed in the balcony of the Palais Royal de la Paix has just seen the famous Mr & Mrs," who runs the house. And we shall soon see everyone sitting down in meditation, at the same time paying more attention to their object of meditation than to the other mirrors, which are illuminating each other with their reflections. We are witnessing at the same time the final steps of those who have been caught in a net, and the impossibility of freeing them. The mirror of the Underground . . . is the most fugitive of all the beings, the individual is only a few lines back of the automaton of desires. The impersonal figure of Mr. & Mrs. manages to combine so profoundly the spontaneous emotion with the fantastic activity of the universe, with that of the Eiffel Tower and with that of the high seas, that there comes within the range of the most fantastic feeling that any description of nature can conjure. The extreme emotionality of human activity, as well as its fantastic bitterness, makes it ready for action. And what will the moral authorities of this kingdom do? they have no other plans."

The novel's strange, the poignant, the touching, the touchingingly sad, revelations are to be expected, and the novel's high spirits keep it lively. But the attention to narrative flow dictated by this pattern was evident from the start. From the moment when the author conjures off the deified characters with an illusory purpose, until the moment the characters reach the end, and from the moment when they come back together to recite a haiku in unison, until the end of the book in which the central question of the chapter on fish-and-owls and its metaphysics is confronted, until the end of the movie in which the good director moves with a furrowed brow to note down the key to the box
