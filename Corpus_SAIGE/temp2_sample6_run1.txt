======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
The first thing I do when I see a woman is to kneel beside her beloved. But if I am going to know her, I have to know her whole life. And to know her whole life with all the abandon and emotion that a decomposed woman makes, with her hair, her eyes, and her whole being. I have not only to do, but also very well do amon, I mean do an excellent, very well, wonderful, without getting lost. I am not always in the presence of this woman. Sometimes I even go so far as to go barefoot. I am in the presence of women. Absolutely no such luck.
[1] Nadja, "madness," as in infinite madness.
[2] She used to live in the South.
[3] She once asked a man if he could borrow her room. If a Negro did, she would often put kisses to his eyes and would whisper a few words to show him her feelings. If he did, she would put kisses to his ears and would whisper a few words to make him say, in particular, that she was very hungry: "Hung, oh hungry, always hungry."
[4] She once asked a man, who was now dead, where she could be buried.
