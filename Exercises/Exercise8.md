# Exercise 8: Jekyll
Time: 5 hours

I forgot to write something up for this exercise so I'm going back retroactively. I was ill for most of lask week (got tested and it wasn't COVID, so it must have just been a horrible cold or the flu--my roommate works at a hospital so who knows) but luckily had started working on this assignment the day after it was introduced. I've worked with Hugo successfully in the past but not without difficulties and assumed (correctly) that Jekyll would be just as difficult.

Installation was a mess and took me several hours and several attempts. I found that my computer was apparently too old to download Chocolatey (something I'd learned in the past but must have forgotten) and had to find a work around to download Ruby Gems. After finding a work around (and ensuring that it wouldn't crash my computer or secretly deliver any viruses), I was able to get Ruby Gems to work so that I could install and deploy Jekyll.

On my first attempt, I ended up with a GitHub Pages website that just would not connect with Jekyll. Also, for that site, I really didn't want the blog format that Jekyll loves to use so much, so, in the end, I abandonned it. 

I tried a second time in my class GitHub repository. I ran into the same error and learned that I needed access to my repo settings in order to deploy Jekyll. I am just now realizing that this is when the illness kicked in and I never attempted to try this again on a repo I could control (although I could control the repo I used for my first attempt). I created the repo and must have fallen asleep. More to come soon!
