My dear, my beloved beauty, there would be a fine song to sing

I do not love, I will not love women
I hate them
I have never loved but Gala

If I deny other women it is to affirm this
That I have found no other woman than Gala
To give me a little taste for living
And a great taste for suicide

The little, the tiniest share of happiness she gave me
Was so very pure
That it had to be pulled from a vast dark mine where
nothing else was ever found
From a vast mine of evil like a great threatening fist
closed about a diamond a tiny nothing that can yet blind
he who dares to open the frightful hand
I hate all women I hate antidotes clouds more fair
than hummingbirds, all ceilings, all prisons
I hate love, I love Gala

Paul

WITHOUT MALICE

Tears to the eyes, misery to the miserable,
Prosaic miseries and colorless tears.
He asks for nothing, he is not unaware,
Sad is he in prison and sad if he is free

The weather is sad, the night is black enough
To keep the blind indoors. The strong
Are sitting, the weak hold power
And the king stands by the sitting queen.

Smiles and sighs of insults rot
In the mouths of mutes and the eyes of cowards.
Take nothing: this one burns, that one blazes!
Your hands are made for your pockets and your brows.

A shadow
All the world’s misfortune
And my love upon it
Like a naked beast.

<|endoftext|>

Make up on the she-devil
Makes her pale
She lived to forget.

Spinning in place in the fog
And her face that all surrounds

Get her to laugh, the zealot,
Was she made of stone?
She will crumble.

**
The curve of your eyes is wrapped around my heart,
Dancing in circles of gentle ways
And if I can’t say what it is that I’ve lived
It’s just that your eyes have not always seen me.

You really must try not to forget me,
I really must try to be outside the world
I’m afraid of existing through this poem alone
Or even yet through this changing sky.
**
The curve of your eyes is wrapped around my heart,
Dancing in circles of gentle ways,
Firm nocturnal cradle, the halo of time
And if I can’t say all it is that I’ve lived
It’s just that your eyes have not always seen me.

Leaves of day and foam of dew,
Reeds of wind and scented smiles,
Wings that wash the world with light,
Boats with freight of sky and sea,
Hunters of sound and wells of color,

Clutch of pearls, bouquet of dawns
Embalming under straw, embalming under snow,

COMMENTARY
The scales
 From one
day to
  anoter
    or else
    the memory
      of just
    death
      un-
      to
    birth.

   The bliss
   one day or
   another,
   of memory
   unto just death,
   just towards birth.

White trees black trees
The youngest of them, nature
Cannot find at random
Its place of birth or aging.

White trees black trees
Tonight revived the day
And randomness but birth
To forget its againg
Or rediscover nature.

IN THE LIGHT OF WHIPS

I

These lovely white apotheosis walls,
Are of great usefulness to me
But in earnest, he who does not pay the piper
Juggles with your trousseau, lavender queen.

Is he free? With imperious finger his throat points out
Hallways where the rustlings of his ankles glide.
From dawn to dusk, his hue outmodes his tattooed skin
And the shelter of his eyes bears cloudless doors.

Oh, regicide! your corset belongs to the minions
And to minions of all kinds. Your simple flesh therein evolves
Oh new mediator, there in your ermine you lick yourself all over
Through the cracks in your smile takes flight a howling beast

That joys only in the heights.

Paul Eluard

II

Blighting metal, daytime metal, nesting star,
Point of dread, fruit in rags, predatory love,
Knife at rest, useless stain, flooded lamp,
Love’s desires, fruits of spite, whorish mirrors.

Of course, greetings to my face!
Where great desires more clearly catch the light than landscapes
Of course, greetings to your spears,
To your cries, to your leaps, to your belly gone to hide!

I have lost, I have won, see what I am mounted on.
**
The violence of the wayward winds
Ships with grizzled faces
A permanent home
And arms for self-defense

An unfrequented beach
A gunshot just the one
Astoundment of the father
Who has been long since dead.

**

You should not see reality as Iam

Specter of your nudity
Specter child of your simplicity
Puerile tamer carnal sleep
Of imaginary freedoms

Feather of clear water fragile rain
Veil of cool caresses
but the hand caressing me
Is opened by my laugh
By my throat is restrained
And repressed

	Treasures of love
If I speak of your mouth
It’s your mouth you should display
It is born it grows it flowers and it dies
It sleeps
Beneath the heavens of your eyes
Where your stars admire and adore
Each other

White trees black trees
Are younger still than nature
To find this randomness of birth one needs
To age

Incredible the conspiracy of angles
	soft as wings

Veil of cool glances

**

Feather of clear water fragile rain
Veil of cool caresses
Of glances and of words
Love that veils that which I love.

Profane men and bodies
Incredible conspiracy
Of angles soft as wings

But the hand caressing me
Is opened by my laugh
By my throat is restrained
And repressed.

Incredible conspiracy
Of discoveries and surprises
**
By their intelligence and tact
An abnormal existence

By this strange taste for risk
A mysterious path

In this dangerous game
Bitterness dies at their feet.
**
Simplicity itself to write
The hand is here for now.
My eyes have shut behind me
The light is burnt the night beheaded
Heavier than the winds, the birds
Have lost their perch.
In feeble sufferings in folds of laughter
I seek my fellow man no more
Life has declined my images are deaf
All the world’s denials have had their final say
They no longer meet but ignore one another
Alone I am alone all alone I have never changed.
**
This prison uncrowned
In the open air
This window in flames
Where the lightning bares its breasts
A night all green
No one smiles in this solitude
Here the fire sleeps on its feet
Through me.
But this gloom is pointless
I can smile
Doltish face whose desires death cares not to wither
Perfectly free face
That will forever keeps its look and its smile.

If I live today
If I am not alone
If someone comes to the window
And if I am that window
If someone comes
His new eyes do not see me
Do not know my thoughts
Refuse to be my cohorts

And divide so as to love.
**
He who sleeps can he have rest
He doesn’t see the night nor the invisible
He has some heavy blankets
And pillows of blood over pillows of mire.

His head is in the garret and his hands are closed
About the tools of weariness
He sleeps to test his strength
The shame of being blind in so Sreat a silence.

On the shores thrown back by the sea
He doesn’t see the night with heavy Storming eyes
Quiet he doesn’t see the silent stances
Of the wind that makes man enter his statues.

Sleeping in goodwill
All the way through death.
**
Villages of lassitude
Where the girls bare their arms
Like fountains
Youth grows within them
And laughs on pointed toes

Villages of lassitude
Where every being is the same.

One woman every night
Travels in deep secret.
**
The mountain the sea and the bathi
In the houses of the poor
Upon the wilted sky that takes the place of shade
A thousand somber lamps and more do hide.

Here is where the insects come
Sputtering shadows from the fire
A much-rusted flame
Splashes one’s sleep
Its bed of flesh and its virtues.

The mass of light roles toward other cares
A field of reflections joins laughter to tears
And closes its eyes and all is fulfilled

To drain the cup of sight

<|endoftext|>


**
By reason for a panicked man
When the tree melts
When the seasons’ sheaves collapse
When the stripped-down glacier
Displays the depths of its heart
Reason head held high
Pathetic mast of fortune
Ant-headed lantern
Reason its yoke of indifference

Show me the exuberant prey
The man who burns his bonds.
**
All the trees all their limbs all their leaves
Grass at the foot of the rocks and huddled houses
Far off the sea that your eye bathes
These images day after day
Vices and virtues so imperfect
The transparency of strollers on the streets of chance
And strolling girls exhaled by your stubborn pursuit
Your dogged obsessions with leaden heart and virgin lips
Vices and virtues so imperfect
The resemblance of permissive looks to the eyes that you have conquered

The confusion of bodies of lassitudes of fervors
The mimicking of words of attitudes of thoughts
Vices and virtues so imperfect

Love is the man who remains incomplete.

In procession the convent must be put to flame.
*
The black-tongued drawing room licks its master
Embalming him his semblance of eternity
*
Gold filings a treasure a platinum
Flask in the depths of a hideous vale
Whose dwellers have all lost their hands
Leads the gamers to leave themselves.
*
A red-headed woman with large breasts crosses the Berezina.
*
Far above the hats
A regiment of eagles galloping on by
It’s a regiment of footwear
All the collections of thwarted fetishists
On their way to hell.
*
Cataclysms of well-got gold
And ill-got coin.
*
There was the sawlike door
There was the strength of walls
Boredom without cause
The accommodating floor
Turned to the die’s winning forsworn face
There were the windows broken
On which the wind’s tragic flesh was rent
There were the protean colors
The swampland borders

Common or garden time
In a forsaken room a room at risk
An empty room.



THE PROBLEM OF SERENITY

To yesterday’s sunshine and breeze
That joins your lips
That coolest caress
To roam your modesty’s winsome seas
In shade to make of them
The jasmine mirrors
The problem of serenity.
**
And so
The natural stream
Is dying by the villas

The boss might talk to his silent son
It’s not every day he laughs
The whole thing valid for twenty minutes
And for four people
Kills your bent for laughter

The son is taken for a drunk.

EVERY RIGHT
Pretend
The flowering shade of flowers hung in springtime
The shortest day of the year and the eskimo night
The agony of the autumn visionaries
The scent of roses and the nettle’s learned sting
Hanging out transparent sheets
In the clearing of your eyes
Display the fire’s ravages its inspired works
And the Eden of its ash
The abstract phenomenon’s fight against the hands of the clock
The wounds of truth the sermons that do not bend
Show yourself.

You can go out in a crystal gown
Your beauty perseveres
Your eyes shed tears caresses smiles
Your eyes have no secrets
No limits.
**
Why are they made to run
They are not made to run
Arriving early
Leaving late

How backward the road
When a slowness is involved

Proofs to the contrary
And uselessness
**
Fatal sun of the host of the living
Your heart is not preserved.

Ancient actor playing water-plays
Worn out miseries quite transparent
The sweet red iron of dawn
Returns the blind their sight
I attend the raising of walls
The struggle between weakness and exhaustion
The speechless winter.
Images gone by are faithful in their way
They imagine fever and delirium
An entire maze in which my complex hand i...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(74%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>day eyes night love sea fish trees light sky birds sun water glass wind hands dreams animals flight heart clouds</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>man time woman made great back long hand life make eyes left head place longer women good men end hands</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>angle poetry exquisite art puts believed ghosts games companions drapery traces roaming 9 visualize trembling swarm interpretations talking enthusiasm scale</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>nadja day work dream sense fact extremely le means thing window des chance period regard impossible manner attention decided show</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>colour coloured towns traveller dusty avenue gradually games shop sighs hotels days gaze slightly painfully travellers delightful 80 slow sight</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>rue idea mind nature sense passage love imagination de human thought pleasure shop café feeling metaphysics knowledge people world concrete</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>flowers miss lies captain breton louis ground morin péret stood aragon hundred benjamin fell stopped asked verdure baignoire car vitrac</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>surrealism surrealist point thought marvelous part mind reality idea art poetry sort ideas shadow dreams men system naville birds surrealists</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>cynthia amie child petitdemange mac louf mother babylon grandmother family hair kerosene woman ll father young cook entire daughter asked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>mr seller broom minister coal salade honourable abencerage tears trees soup left heart boomerang started dust letter tree handkerchief stopped</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
