André Gide’s conversion

Mister Comrade Gide
sings the ‘Young Guard’* between his arse and his shirt-tails
and tells himself it’s time to flash his belly like a red flag
Communist
a bit  a lot  with all his heart
not at all
answer the balls of the choirboy he depilates
like a tomato rocked by the wind
Mister Comrade Gide makes a hell of a red flag
that no salad would want
a red flag which hides a cross
dipped in vitriol
good and French like no other concierge’s dog
which bites its tail while listening to the Marseillaise being hiccupped
which gives birth to
Mister Comrade Gide

Oh yes Mister Comrade Gide
You'll have the hammer and sickle
the sickle through your guts
and the hammer down your throat



Life of Foch* the murderer

From a pool of liquid dung one day a bubble rose
and burst
From the smell the father could tell
He’ll be a famous killer
Snotty filthy the vermin grew up
and started talking of Revenge
Revenge for what For paternal manure
or for the cow which made the manure
At six he was farting into a bugle
At eight two turds decorated his sleeve
From a pool of liquid dung one day a bubble rose
At ten he was commanding the lice on his head
and the itching let his parents know
he has talent
At fifteen he was raped by a donkey
and they made a lovely couple
they begot a pair of boots with spurs
into which he disappeared like a dirty sock

It’s nothing said the father
his marshal’s baton came out of the loo
That’s the kind of career it is
The career was shining and the worker well up to it
Along his way vomit spurted like geysers
and spattered him
He is everything that’s best in this type
bilious puke of military medals
and nauseating plonk from the legion of honour
which grew little by little

This puffy calf’s lung* stretched out
and during the war provoked the bystanders to say
He’s a fine lad He’s wearing his lungs on his chest

Everything was going well until the day his wife picked up
the concierge’s cat
Nothing could be done
the cat threw itself on the calf’s lung
the minute it appeared
and finally it was fatal the cat swallowed it
Without a calf’s lung Foch was no longer Foch
and like a butcher he died of a corpse wound



Joan of Arc

A cowpat haloed with flies
said one day to Joan of Arc
The little birds have no rollerskates
but Jesus has frozen feet
the cowpat was next to an old stick of rotten wood
which toads exerted themselves in jumping over
and each one as it leaped gave itself a name
Saint John Saint Paul Saint Louis Saint Theresa Saint Arseho

So Joan understood that she was before God
and swallowed the cowpat like a relic
Immediately God crystalised in the form of hemorrhoids
and all the dogs of Domremy licked her behind
But Joan knew that God inhabited her
and told her every night
I am here by the will of the pope
and I will suddenly come out by force of farts
Suddenly God spat so far that Joan could send kicks
into the backside of the horizon
God and the horizon cried out
King Charles VII hunts bedbugs under the staircase
but each crushed bedbug gives birth to two thousand lice
She also makes the sign of the cross over the rubbish bins
so that the lice hidden in them can follow her
like a dog on a scent
the one leading to the king

The king runs off chased by the swine
that the priests cover with holy water
they drink it and sanctify themselves
the swine go off to Jerusalem waving crosses
they want to suck Christ’s bones like chewing gum
and the king flees

Joan joins him in a pissoir
and they love each other like urine loves damp slate
One day at Reims a rotten apple falls on the king’s head
from it Joan makes him a crown
blessed by fourteen archbishops with putrescible gazes

A vengeful Altar-cruet hits Joan and suddenly she is wounded
the king devours her breasts and her feet
which smell foul like spoiled vegetables
and now she’s cured

Meanwhile the English were raising their lice in France
and the English lice were beating the French lice
One day a piece of English louse clothing covered Joan’s body
and suddenly she is a prisoner
For a long time she ate lice
hoping to resemble them
but she always remained a bedbug popping under the donkey’s hooves
a foul bedbug so filthy and flaccid
that one day as oily as the Christ they had to
burn her to warm up the lice

Saint Joan of Arc patron of bedbugs pray for the French


The sixth of February*

Long live the sixth of February
grumbles the tobacco juice
dressed in a fleur-de-lis turd

How wonderful it was
The busses were burning like old-time heretics
and the horses’ eyes
ripped out with our stilettos*
landed on the COPS so lardy and revolting
that they could have been burning crosses*

Long live the sixth of February
I almost burn down the maritime ministry
like a newstand
too bad the public urinals aren't burning

Long live the sixth of February
town concillors cretinized by the tricolour scarves
in order to rally all the lice and bedbugs
made their blood run under the bludgeons
which suited them less well than the firing post*

Long live the sixth of February
Yellow green rotten priests
caressing the buttocks of teenage boys
while singing the Marseillaise and some canticles
while shooting at their brother cops

Long live the sixth of February
and long live the seventh
for two days I shouted
Death to Cachin Death to Blum
and I stole whatever I could from the stores
whose windows I broke
I even stole a doll I'll send to Maurras
so he can try to rape it
while shouting Down with thieves


The Fourway Pact*

The four of them all lice-ridden were dancing in front of a beefsteak
And as they danced their lice fell to the ground
I am French said one of them
light and sprightly as a cop beating a worker
and if I have blue blood and a pussy white wound it’s because my nose is red

I am English said the second
and since the pound started dropping I feel my feet running like an old brie cheese

I am Italian said the third
fortunately I have the pope for a noodle
since the macaroni has been making machine-gun barrels

I am German said the last one
Fascist answered the echo from the latrines
and beneath each of these gentlemen
a little urine ran out
tracing for the German a map without the worm-shaped corridor*
for the Italian a horizon of greasy fasces
for the Frenchman the left bank of the Rhine
for the Englishman a missisippi of pounds sterling
Shit said the Frenchman who ate the Italian’s nose
while the German was spitting into the Englishman’s ear
and soon nothing was left but a little pile of generals
haloed by flies
which circled around the four flags
planted in their arses


The heroic death of Lieutenant Condamine de la Tour

For seven centuries Condamine de la Tour
his arms stretched like the hands of a clock
showing quarter past nine
standing on his red-white-and-blue canteen
commanded his fourteen lobsters
Through his pierced brain the breezes sang
Will you drop dead you pig of a sell-out
But from the sky as black as the forehead of his fathers
no crayfish came to the aid of his lobsters
Only the occasional splat of a fingernail
warned him that the cauldrons were changing sex
and the lettuces losing their ears
ran to ask him the secret of his pubic hair

Suddenly in the mouldy air
a nail bored with the noise of darkness
a nail blue and green like a spring morning
2, 437 bedbugs came out of his nose
4, 628 Chinese lanterns penetrated his ears

He cried out
I Condamine de la Tour am looking for the massacres
of children in the cloud-shoes
of the unknown soldier in the closet
But Jesus threw the unknown soldier into his rubbish bin
and the swine ate him
and the Alsations ate the swine

That is how you grew up Condamine de la Tour
how you grew up like a swine
and the unknown soldier’s navel has become your own
But today Jesus put his foot in your strumpot*
which he used as a clog
both feet in the same clog
That’s why we have a god
and why his priests have shoes
which look like their faces

Rotten Condamine de la Tour
The pope will make two hosts from your eyes
for your Moroccan sergeant
and your prick will become his marshal’s baton
Rotten Condamine de la Tour
Rotten spineless filth

Listen

If you sheltered me like a may bug in a cupboard
bristling with snowdrops coloured by your ocean voyage eyes
monday tuesday etc wouldn’t be more than a fly
in a plaza bordered by ruined palaces
from which would issue an immense vegetation of coral
and of embroidered shawls
where one sees
felled trees depart obliquely
to blend in with park benches
where I slept awaiting your arrival
like a forest that awaits the passing of a comet to see clearly
in its underbrush whimpering like a chimney
calling the log it desires since it yawns
like an abandoned quarry
and like a staircase in a tower we would climb
to see ourselves disappear
in the distance
like a table swept away by the flood


Today

Let her smile surge up in the sky black as a slave escaped from a marsh
and the huge jack hammers that reduce my brain to rice paper
as likely to become a slag soup as a banana flower
cease their song of camels drinking in the mirages
because the oyster’s cadaver has brutally leaped
on the potbellied osprey who demands an hour from passing women
in the form of R of O of S of A
who by the courage of the vulgar soapskin armchair
have turned to dust on a sheet of lava encrusted with eagles
blue as a racing car that will never finish
because the kilometres following the coasts
and the sharp turns preceding the descents
carry your name like a coat of arms
where one sees
that 4+4=♋︎
straight as a greasy pole whose summit I will attain
so that you may look at me not like a kilo of sugar
but as a night whose seam you have unstitched


Waiting

Battered by the huge plates of time
the man advances like the veins of marble hoping to spare their eyes
in a torrent where the fan-headed trout
dragging heavy chariots of champagne bubbles
which blacken your hair of fortified castle
where the pellitory doesn’t dare venture
for fear of being devoured
beyond the great glacial plain where dinosaurs still brood over
their eggs from which will not emerge haemetite tulips
but caravans of blue-bellied porcupines
for fear of being swallowed by the fountain of sea lightning
created by your gaze where impalpable night moths whirl
dressed in closed train stations where I search for the key to open the signal
without finding anything
but frozen horseshoes
which leap up like an umbrella in an ear
and ducks of fresh nett
solemn as oysters


I can’t sleep

Tell me reflection of cobalt
why the flight of crows which surrounds you
as the coal clasps the fire which created it by swallowing red peppers
that have always placed red eggs on your Saint-George's lips
who goes up to Pigalle
swings in the hammock of the square
enlists like a bullet into a torso with balls
so resembling a gyroscope
one might think it was Pluto abducting Proserpine in his handkerchief
disappearing on the horizon like the two Channel Islands of your eyes
near the Channel of your nose
which is a moon-beam in the cellar I
burgle
hoping to find a snapdragon in the shape of a yes
without ruts from a dentist’s chair
without a net to capture the mosquito-headed peaches
without mosquitoes asleep like a timer in the corner of a forest
without a timer gnawing the skeletons of my elders and hers
the way a head of garlic in the mayonnaise
truly projects
tonight
if only one sprinkles it with petals of bitter almonds
a strong bouquet of new wine
a little sour
a little sweet
sour and sweet
like a new volcano
whose lava will reproduce indefinitely your face

One morning

There are endless screams
brayings of earth shaken like a fan dismantled
by jellied moles
sobs of planks being gutted
long as a locomotive which will be born
of the convulsions of rebellious trees which no longer want to let the sap run
that the metro refuses to carry ostriches
in its tunnel of badly shaven beards
there are screams
of vitriol spiders that I swallow unwittingly
near this dried-up river spouted from a pipe
which is none other than a long muzzle
a bit warm
a bit grumpier than a nearly empty kettle
this river you don’t see any more than the dust of a Host
the wind has mixed
with the dust of the parish priest resembling copper sulphate
and with that of the church more twisted than an old corkscrew
for you are no more here than I am there without you
and the whole world is unkempt


Do you know

My sandpaper head rubbing so vigorously on a crystal goblet
made in your image of a bird a wild boar impedes from its first flight
is full of the spindrift of your eyes similar to two oranges no one will ever pick
Your eyes which are perhaps a stone exploded like a lightning-struck tree
just like the little heart I have in my pocket
beside a stove redder than a burning zeppelin
resembling the budding of an aloe flower
that would be a red flag
more torn than hair in the wind
that wants to caress you like a newborn bird
and so blue it seems a dead leaf becoming green again
so shiny it seems a block of sealing wax in a bath tub
where you don’t appear anymore than a water lily in the middle of the woods
no more than a wild strawberry in an inner tube
no more than my life around the corner


Where are you

I would speak to you cracked crystal howling like a dog on a night of flailing sheets
like a dismasted boat the foam begins to invade
where the cat meows because all the rats have left
I would speak to you like a tree uprooted by the storm
which so shook the telegraph wires
they seem a brush for mountains resembling a tiger’s lower jaw
which slowly tears me with a hideous noise of a ba ttered-in door
I would speak to you like a metro train broken down at the entrance
of a station I enter with a splinter in a toe like a bird in a vineyard
which will yield no more wine than a barricaded street
where I wander like a wig in a fireplace
which hasn’t heated anything so long
it thinks itself a cafe counter
where the circles left by the glasses trace a chain
I would only say to you
I love you like the grain of wheat loves the sun rising above its blackbird head


Always

Nothing on the twisted horizon more worn than a rail about to crumble
and provoke the most sensational catastrophe of the year
the blond hairs of the horizon have gotten lost
like a boat of buttercups beginning to drift
along a coast bristling with elephant tusks
which bray like shops on the verge of bankruptcy
Nothing on the horizon when your two eyes of dry sherry
do not allow a single ray of this light to pass
where
miniscule
rushed along distorted by a thousand rival prisms
pin headed
cow headed
the blood which flows from me like a cat that has stolen a cutl...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(47%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>mr seller broom minister coal salade honourable abencerage tears trees soup left heart boomerang started dust letter tree handkerchief stopped</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(41%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>man time woman made great back long hand life make eyes left head place longer women good men end hands</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>day eyes night love sea fish trees light sky birds sun water glass wind hands dreams animals flight heart clouds</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>flowers miss lies captain breton louis ground morin péret stood aragon hundred benjamin fell stopped asked verdure baignoire car vitrac</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>surrealism surrealist point thought marvelous part mind reality idea art poetry sort ideas shadow dreams men system naville birds surrealists</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>nadja day work dream sense fact extremely le means thing window des chance period regard impossible manner attention decided show</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>angle poetry exquisite art puts believed ghosts games companions drapery traces roaming 9 visualize trembling swarm interpretations talking enthusiasm scale</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>rue idea mind nature sense passage love imagination de human thought pleasure shop café feeling metaphysics knowledge people world concrete</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>colour coloured towns traveller dusty avenue gradually games shop sighs hotels days gaze slightly painfully travellers delightful 80 slow sight</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>cynthia amie child petitdemange mac louf mother babylon grandmother family hair kerosene woman ll father young cook entire daughter asked</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
