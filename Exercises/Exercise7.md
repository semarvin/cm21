# Exercise 7: Publishing
## time: 2 hours

I had a lot of trouble with getting Chocolatey to work (I guess my laptop is too old, which is fair) so I ended up installing RubyGems directly from the site (which required a separate installer and was very annoying). Once I got RubyGems and Jekyll installed, it was relatively smooth sailing. I really hate the blog-style format of this site. Like, a lot. 

Then I ran into an error when trying to publish. I made a gh-pages brance of my GitHub repo but no publish button appeared. The only option I have for manipulating the repo is this:
```
Create a Pull Request from your current branch
The current branch (gh-pages) is already published to GitHub. Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on your changes.
```
But I couldn't create a pull request because both branches were the identical. So, not sure how to publish my GitHub pages site.

Just kidding, I can publish the site fine. I got confused because my repository is already published. Here's the link to the static site:
