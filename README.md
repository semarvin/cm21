# Ellie Marvin's Surrealist and AI-Generated Corpora

This GitHub repository contains a variety of corpora, data, data visualizations, and write-ups. My research revolves around the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Surrealism. I have identified three corpora to aid me with my research, described below. Much of the work I did for this project lied in digitizing texts from Corpus S, cleaning them, and feeding them to SAIGE, a model of GPT-2, in order to generate new "surreal" text [(more information here)](https://saige.netlify.app/).



## Navigation:

- Corpus_AI (folder): working corpus of GPT-2-generated texts
- Corpus_S (folder): working corpus of Surrealist literature (this folder is not available to the public due to copyright laws)
- Corpus_SAIGE (folder): all of the samples generated by SAIGE separated by temperature (which controls the amount of randomness in the text)
- Data_Viz (folder): all of the components for data visualizations, including tables, R notebooks, and the images themselves
- Topic_Modeling (folder): results from TopicModelingTool
- corpus_AI_metadata.csv, corpus_S_metadata.csv, corpus_SAIGE_metadata.csv: metadata for each corpus, respectively
- The content, public, and themes folders, as well as config.toml and netlify.toml, are all website-building components
