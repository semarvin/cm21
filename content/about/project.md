This website presents a series of corpora and associated analysis, metadata, and visualizations. The corpora are as follows:
1. Corpus AI: A collection of texts generated by GPT-2
2. Corpus S: A collection of Surrealist texts (not available to the public); not all of these texts are digitized
3. On occasion, I also work with samples I have generated from a model of GPT-2 trained on Corpus S and named SAIGE
You can read more about these corpora [here](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week2/) and more about SAIGE [here](https://saige.netlify.app/). I have included a full write-up about my [data cleaning process](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week3/) which was done with Tesseract, Microsoft OneNote, and Sublime Text 3. I have assembled [metadata tables](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week13/) for all three corpora.

The main dataset that I'm working with is a compilation of all the named entities in Corpus S and determining who the Surrealists were writing about. I have a post [here](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week4/) which discusses how I generated this dataset and a post [here](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week6/) with preliminary visualizations of this dataset. More fleshed-out visualizations and analysis are available at this post (not yet published).

To view and download cleaned plain text files from Corpus AI, go to [this post](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week12/). To see how this website was created, read [this post](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week8/) recounting my experience with GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Hugo and [this post](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week10/) about hosting a website on Netlify.
