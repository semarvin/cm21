I am currently a [graduate student](https://pih.fsu.edu/person/ellie-marvin) at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu//) working on my MA in [Digital Humanities](https://pih.fsu.edu/digital-humanities-ma-program). In May of 2019, I earned my BA from FSU and graduated Summa Cum Laude. I double majored in English and Humanities with a minor in Film Studies. My interests and hobbies include writing, editing, graphic design, art, photography, and film. My most recent experience in graphic design is my internship at [The Dali Museum](https://thedali.org/) in St. Petersburg, Florida during the summer of 2017. I am currently based out of Tallahassee and will be graduating in April 2021. You can view my portfolio [here](http://semarvin.com/) and contact me via the links below.
