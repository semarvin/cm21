For this exercise, I chose to work with some data that will factor into the corpus I’m using to train GPT-2 for my Master’s project. The data is an excerpt from a book of poetry, Paul Eluard’s Letters to Gala. This text has a table at the beginning of it of the chronology of Eluard and Gala’s lives. Since the text is not in the public domain, I used scans from a copy of the text and ran them through Tesseract, an OCR software. As the images were very clean, the data only needed minimal cleaning up. Tesseract did a poor job with the table so I had to fix that output up a bit. I turned the table into a .csv file to put into Palladio (and then realized my error and separated the values with tabs instead of commas). 

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the text I chose, I wasn’t able to glean a lot of insights from Voyant or Palladio. This is the only text I have to work with that has a table in it, but it’s a fairly short excerpt so Voyant wasn’t able to tell me much. It was interesting to see the timeline that Palladio had put out to quickly see when Eluard and Gala were the most active. Aside from Gala and Eluard, the most frequently used terms for the entire excerpt were eyes, like, day, night, love, and death. I have yet to digitize the other Eluard collections I have, but it will be interesting to compare Letters to Gala’s most-used terms to his other poems. I wonder if his poems for his (ex-)wife Gala used more romantic language than his other poems. The fact that “like” appears so often tells me that he may have used a lot of similes. I am not yet familiar enough with his style to say whether or not this is characteristic of his poetry.
