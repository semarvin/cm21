This week, I am revisiting data visualization, a concept I struggled with earlier. I consider myself to be fairly competent with data visualization in R and fairly creative, but I am struggling in my exploration of successful ways to visualize this data. So far, the most success has come from using [Google's Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/navigation/reporting) which I used to create [two pages of preliminary visualizations for Corpus S](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/cca3b7c1-a82f-4a8e-85ac-7adc01ae7959/page/4B71B), some of which have been recreated here.

I have been advised against pie charts and understand that they can be problematic, but this graphic has perhaps been the most helpful in presenting a visualization to me which accurately communicated a great deal about my dataset. This visualization clearly shows who the Surrealists were writing about--namely, themselves, for the most part, but also other writers, poets, and artists, as well as French politicians and royalty. A chart at the top of the first page of the Google Data Studio sheet shows who they were talking about the most: Surrealists like Paul Eluard, Benjamin Peret, Robert Desnos, and others.

Yet another pie chart was helpful for me to understand the general composition of Corpus S. By comparing each texts' word counts, I was able to understand which authors are represented most and which are represented least. Louis Aragon and Andre Breton are very present in my corpus, while Paul Eluard, who contributed to works to this corpus, contributed a much smaller number of words than I had expected. This knowledge helped me to better understand the text that SAIGE generated; it leaned much more heavily on the styles of Breton and Aragon's fiction than of Eluard's poetry, which is why most of the samples skewed towards prose and away from poetry, a result I had not expected. 
Still, pie charts bug me and I hope to be able to visualize this data in a better way, especially the data from the named entities dataset. In terms of creating a scatterplot with R, this horrific, ugly, massive chart is the closest I ever got to presenting my data (warning--this file is massive and may take a while to load):

You can read my process in creating this monster of a chart in the last half of [this unwieldy blog post](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week6/). I am more interested in presenting the Role variable than any of the others; I do not need to show all of the names, but I also want to find a way to show when a person was mentioned in more than one source. After fiddling around in R, I was able to produce two viable charts. I have included my R Notebook at the end of this post to show my code and process. 
![Bar chart of roles](/images/roles.png)
This first chart shows the occupations of all of the named entities in Corpus S. It illustrates what groups of people the Surrealists were writing about the most, or at least those that appeared the most in Corpus S. This chart excludes the Surrealists, who were mentioned 68 times in this corpus. Since they are so over-represented, they were throwing off all of my visualizations. I like this chart as I feel it accurately describes who the Surrealists were writing about the most--writers, artists, and French people, mostly--but it does showcase the fact that I was not able to determine the occupations for many of the named entities in this corpus. I was either unable to determine which person the Surrealists referred to as several people of that name were notable in history or I was unable to find anything at all about the name used. Still, I think this is a good visualization of my dataset.

Lastly, I created this bar chart showing only those who were mentioned in more than one text from Corpus S. While I don't love that this chart doesn't include roles, an informed person would likely recognize most or all of these names. That data is available in [this table linked on my GitHub repository for this project](https://github.com/semarvin/cm21/blob/main/Exercises/named_entities_in_corpus_s.csv).

Overall, I believe that the penultimate table would help someone better understand my project and my data. It effectively communicates to a broad audience what kinds of people the Surrealists were writing about the most.
