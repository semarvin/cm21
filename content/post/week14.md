This week, I am revisiting data visualization, a concept I struggled with earlier. I consider myself to be fairly competent with data visualization in R and fairly creative, but I am struggling in my exploration of successful ways to visualize this data. So far, the most success has come from using [Google's Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/navigation/reporting) which I used to create [two pages of preliminary visualizations for Corpus S](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/cca3b7c1-a82f-4a8e-85ac-7adc01ae7959/page/4B71B), some of which have been recreated here.

I have been advised against pie charts and understand that they can be problematic, but this graphic has perhaps been the most helpful in presenting a visualization to me which accurately communicated a great deal about my dataset. This visualization clearly shows who the Surrealists were writing about--namely, themselves, for the most part, but also other writers, poets, and artists, as well as French politicians and royalty. A chart at the top of the first page of the Google Data Studio sheet shows who they were talking about the most: Surrealists like Paul Eluard, Benjamin Peret, Robert Desnos, and others.
