For this week's exercise, I am sharing a few cleaned-up versions of texts generated by [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/tags/gpt-2/). These .txt files have been linked to this page via GitHub and can be downloaded directly from GitHub.

Most of these texts came from [NaNoGenMo](https://nanogenmo.github.io/) is a twist on the popular NaNoWriMo--or, National Novel Writing Month--in which partcipants aim to generate 50,000 words of text using whatever coding, AI, or scripting they can. These texts and their generative codes are then gathered up and published on GitHub. Specifically, I looked at texts generated during [NaNoGenMo 2019](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019). I also included a few others that I found through various means.

My own textual generation research is completed with GPT-2, so I was most interested in looking at texts generated wtih GPT-2, an Artificial Intelligence by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). All of the texts gathered here have been generated by GPT-2.

Next week I will assemble a comprehensive metadata table for these texts. For the time being, a basic metadata table can be found [here](https://github.com/semarvin/cm21/blob/main/corpus_AI_metadata.csv). All of the linked texts were generated by their original creators, cited in that table. The table also includes links to the original projects. I did not generate or write any of these texts; I only processed them into clean plain-text files.
