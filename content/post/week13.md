This post includes metadata tables for the [corpus posted last week](https://cm21.netlify.app/post/week12/) as well as the Surrealist corpus and the samples generated by SAIGE. I also included a table of all of the named entities from Corpus S as that has been the main source of data that I've been working with for the past few weeks. Identifying the names used and who they refer to has been an interesting endeavor and an enlightening one at that. I aim to also develop a table of the named entities in the samples generated by SAIGE for comparison.

Here is the metadata table for Corpus AI, as mentioned above. This small table includes the author, name, genre, source URL, and word count for each source as well as the top fifteen most frequently used words (atomized and categorized together). The URLs are not hyperlinked to preserve the format.

Here is the metadata table for Corpus S, which is not publicly available due to copyright concerns. This table includes similar information to the above table, but also with publication dates for the original document and the translation used (when applicable). I was not able to digitize all of these texts due to time constraints so I do not have word counts for print copies of texts.

The last metadata table references the samples generated by SAIGE which can all be viewed [here](https://saige.netlify.app/). They do not have titles or authors as SAIGE generated all of them and did not write titles for any of them. From the linked website: "I initially generated eight samples at three different temperatures, but later generated between eight and sixteen more at each temperature to better understand SAIGE’s abilities. Temperature controls the amount of entropy in the text. Generating samples at low temperatures instructs SAIGE to choose the most likely combination of words based on its training data; conversely, then, using higher temperatures increases the amount of randomness in SAIGE’s word selection. Usually, temperature values are between 1 and 0, so I generated samples at temperatures of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 in order to understand SAIGE’s full range of textual generation. Each sample generated was about 800 words long, though some were much shorter and some were much longer. SAIGE generated unconditional samples in order to evaluate SAIGE’s text without my prompting."

Finally, this table identifies all of the named entities in Corpus S (of the texts that have been digitized). This table is very simple but groups entities by name rather than source (as it was organized previously) and includes more detailed versions of the roles than a previous version. This is the data I have been working with the most this semester.
