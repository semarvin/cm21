      <description>This website presents a series of corpora and associated analysis, metadata, and visualizations. The corpora are as follows:
 Corpus AI: A collection of texts generated by GPT-2 Corpus S: A collection of Surrealist texts (not available to the public); not all of these texts are digitized On occasion, I also work with samples I have generated from a model of GPT-2 trained on Corpus S and named SAIGE  You can read more about these corpora here and more about SAIGE here.</description>
